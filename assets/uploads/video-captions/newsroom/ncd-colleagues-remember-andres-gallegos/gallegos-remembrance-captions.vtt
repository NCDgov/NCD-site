CHAIRMAN GALLEGOS:
I was honored to be designated as Chairman

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.488
of the National Council on Disability.

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:08.575
I am a Hispanic male with fair

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.628
complexion, exceedingly gray hair, black frame

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.595
glasses,

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.064
and I am a proud member

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:17.967
of the Disability community Class of 1996,

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:19.319
having sustained a spinal cord

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.003
injury

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.321
resulting in quadriplegia

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.657
in an automobile accident.

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:26.509
As a person with a spinal cord injury,

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.461
I, like so many others,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.996
have experienced the realities

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.182
of trying to attain medical care

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:34.701
while confronting the seismic barriers

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.602
that still exist.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.704
despite the over 30 years

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.521
since the Americans

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.791
with Disabilities Act became law.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.695
So many of us have stories to tell.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.063
Sir, you wrote the Americans

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:49.382
with Disabilities Act.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.719
That's a big friggin deal (audience laughs).

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.255
Gentlemen, the National Council on Disability,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:55.889
with nine

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.323
Presidentially and Congressionally

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.942
appointed members,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:01.044
carries a statutory mission

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:02.779
to advise the President,

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:06.750
his administration, Congress and federal agencies

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.752
on all policy matters

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:10.854
impacting people with disabilities.

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:11.271
The health

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.205
and well-being of people

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.390
with disabilities have long been ignored

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.842
in this country.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.328
This occurs despite the existence

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.264
of an overwhelming body of studies and reports

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:24.117
that unequivocally document the significant

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.520
and continuing prevalence of health disparities

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.873
that exist between people with disabilities

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:31.608
and our non-disabled counterparts.

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:33.893
The National Council on Disability

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.780
was fighting for federal legislation

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.197
to protect

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.984
the rights of persons with disabilities

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.118
since its inception.

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:44.120
NCD has worked to develop

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.121
a health equity

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.792
framework to provide policymakers in Congress

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.960
and in the administration

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.862
with a blueprint to take action.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:53.663
The adoption

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.732
of enforceable medical diagnostic equipment

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.885
standards is just one step towards health

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.138
equity for persons with mobility disabilities

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.740
and is just one component

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.725
of NCDâ€™s pursuit of health

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.812
equity for all people with disabilities--for

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:10.680
an all of government approach

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.832
to address health disparities.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.084
The framework was one year in the making,

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:15.952
with the input of

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:16.703
our then-Council

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.706
members, members of the Disability community

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.742
and a Dream Team of 14 advisors

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.444
comprised of health care disparities

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.862
researchers,

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:28.798
physicians caring for people with disabilities,

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:31.217
health care and disability law professors,

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.302
among others.

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:33.419
It's a matter of attaining

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.489
and maintaining good health. It's

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:37.590
critically important for

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.491
everyone,

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.643
but more so for persons with disabilities.

00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:41.778
It's truly

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:44.147
the predicate to our ability to live,

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:46.916
our ability to learn and our ability to work

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:50.870
and earn. Into the forefront of discussions

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.471
that are taking place

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.639
in medical schools

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.642
and perhaps at the associations here.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:59.612
I have to impart with you, our house is on fire.

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.081
The issues that we're talking about here,

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.950
when individuals

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.654
like me can't get weighed at medical appointments

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:08.605
because there's no wheelchair

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.139
accessible weight scales,

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.124
when we don't get transferred

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.959
onto examination tables

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.478
for full physical examination

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:16.796
because of the inability

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:19.799
or the unwillingness of providers to do so.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.036
And then we see a heightened percentage of people

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.537
with spinal cord injuries

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.705
and mobility disabilities

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.408
being diagnosed with colon cancer

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.792
because they're simply not being checked

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.194
or prostate cancer

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:33.529
because they're simply not being checked.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.816
We don't have time for polite

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.637
conversations in your respective schools.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.057
We need some action, and that has to happen.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:49.045
And so I impart to you that our house is

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:59.105
on fire and these issues need resolution.

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:00.023
Let's remember that

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:01.741
disability is a natural part

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.644
of the human condition.

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:06.412
Let us remember that disability

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.064
is not a characteristic

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:11.034
that stands alone, but it is one that intersects

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.487
with all other aspects of a person's identity,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:18.908
such as age, race, ethnicity, income level,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.712
sexual orientation, gender identity and religion.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.431
Let us recommit to shaping a future

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.217
in which all members of this beautiful community

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:28.901
can have

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:33.423
and enjoy full rights free from discrimination,

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:36.793
to live self-directed, independent lives,

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.529
to achieve our full potential.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.649
Achieving our full potential is only possible

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:46.085
if we're able to attain, maintain good health.
