WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:08.720
CLAUDIA GORDON: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.880
It's good to see my fellow Council members

00:11.880 --> 00:14.880
present today,

00:15.080 --> 00:17.000
and the NCD staff.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.200
They're a hard working staff.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.240
It's a little but mighty staff--

00:24.320 --> 00:30.000
the agency is small,
but very, very effective.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.080
My name is Claudia Gordon,

00:33.240 --> 00:38.880
and I am the Vice Chair
of the NCD Council.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.920
I also currently serve as Acting Chair.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.280
This is following the sudden

00:47.280 --> 00:52.800
and untimely passing of our previous
Chair,

00:52.880 --> 00:58.240
Andrés Gallegos.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.640
That took place this past December

01:01.720 --> 01:04.720
unfortunately.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.560
We will take some time to honor him

01:07.560 --> 01:10.440
today.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.200
But I would like to now

01:12.200 --> 01:16.280
officially call that meeting to order.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.320
Before I do that,

01:18.320 --> 01:19.200
for those of you

01:19.200 --> 01:24.280
who are joining this meeting,
the National Council on Disability,

01:24.360 --> 01:26.400
we are an independent,

01:26.400 --> 01:31.840
nonpartisan federal agency.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.040
We are charged with providing advice

01:36.120 --> 01:40.880
to the President and to Congress

01:40.960 --> 01:43.560
and to other federal agencies

01:43.560 --> 01:47.760
on different matters and issues that arise

01:47.840 --> 01:50.640
and that are connected to disability.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.000
That's who we are.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.080
And we achieve that end goal by reviewing
and evaluating

01:55.240 --> 01:58.760
different policies and emerging issues

01:58.840 --> 02:01.840
that specifically impact
the disability community.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.520
So with that, I will now go ahead and ask

02:05.760 --> 02:09.000
Miss Netterie Lewis

02:09.080 --> 02:11.000
to take over,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.400
beginning with roll call

02:14.480 --> 02:18.440

04:35.880 --> 04:38.040
Acting Chair.

04:38.040 --> 04:44.280
Madam Claudia Gordon.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.600
Thank you, Ms..

04:45.600 --> 04:48.240
Lewis.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.640
I think before we proceed,

04:50.640 --> 04:55.320
I want to make sure
the communication is good for everyone.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.360
We will be using captioning.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.760
We also --
I'm using American Sign Language.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.440
So we have interpreters.

05:01.440 --> 05:07.280
Hopefully our participants who rely on
American Sign Language can also see me

05:07.280 --> 05:11.080
clearly and also see the interpreters
for anyone who needs that.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.000
And also that captioning is available.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.240
So that's just a quick accessibility

05:16.320 --> 05:20.560
check and the interpreter who's currently

05:20.640 --> 05:23.960
speaking English for me right
now, interpreting is off camera,

05:24.040 --> 05:26.320
but you should see the other interpreters

05:26.320 --> 05:29.600
who will be interpreting into ASL

05:29.680 --> 05:31.960
on screen.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.080
Also, I want to mention that Shawn

05:34.080 --> 05:38.080
Kennemer, our Council member,
will not be present today

05:38.160 --> 05:41.160
and has asked me to be his proxy

05:41.160 --> 05:44.320
for any future voting.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.400
So I just wanted to bring that up

05:47.640 --> 05:52.240
and make sure that we have
that amendment for today

05:52.320 --> 05:56.760
added to the notes
that I will be serving as proxy.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.720
Now, our first order of business

05:58.720 --> 06:01.720
today is to proceed with a vote

06:01.720 --> 06:04.680
for from the council members
to accept the minutes.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.920
Actually, let me say accept the Council
agenda first.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.640
So I would love to get a motion
from our fellow

06:12.640 --> 06:15.640
Council members to proceed with that.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.080
The accepting of the agenda as presented.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.000
Anyone would like to move?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.480
CM BITTNER: I move that we accept

06:24.560 --> 06:30.640
the agenda as presented.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.320
GORDON:  Thank you,

06:31.320 --> 06:32.000
Sascha.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.680
Can I get a second for that?

06:35.760 --> 06:40.240
CM Romano: Second.

06:40.320 --> 06:40.880
AC Gordon: Okay.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.400
Thank you, Neil.

06:46.480 --> 06:50.480
Any discussion?

06:50.560 --> 06:54.240
If there's no discussion,
then I will turn it back over to Ms..

06:54.240 --> 06:57.640
Lewis to collect the votes.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.160
LEWIS: Okay.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.760
Thank you.

06:59.760 --> 07:05.560
Calling on Hoskie Benally.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.080
Okay.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.480
We're still waiting for Hoskie.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.600
Sascha Bittner?
CM BITTNER: Yes.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.640
LEWIS: Theo Braddy?

07:15.640 --> 07:16.840
CM BRADDY: Here.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.320
LEWIS: Noting that Shawn Kennemer is not present.

07:20.400 --> 07:25.080
Risa Rifkind?
RIFKIND: Yes.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.360
LEWIS: Neal Romano.
CM ROMANO: Yes.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.440
LEWIS: Lastly, Emily Voorde.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.520
CM VOORDE: Yes.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.760
LEWIS: I yield the floor back to you Vice Chair,

07:36.760 --> 07:37.800
Acting Chair.

07:37.800 --> 07:43.640
Madam Claudia Gordon.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.320
AC GORDON: Okay.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.240
Thank you, Mr.

07:45.240 --> 07:45.960
Ms.. Lewis.

07:45.960 --> 07:51.920
And yes, I'm in favor as well.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.440
Okay.

07:52.440 --> 07:57.320
I actually wanted to introduce the video
first for everyone because some may not

07:57.400 --> 08:00.640
have had the good fortune
of being familiar with Andrés.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.480
So I want to take this opportunity
just to share a little bit

08:04.560 --> 08:11.680
before we went ahead
and showed the honor tribute video to him.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.440
My fellow Council members.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.360
I think we haven't accepted the actual
meeting minutes as well before the video.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.080
And can you confirm
if we've actually accepted the meetings,

08:23.160 --> 08:27.400
the minutes, or should we do that
after the video is shown?

08:27.480 --> 08:31.440
EXEC DIR SOMMERS MCINTOSH: We have that queued up for the Executive Committee

08:31.520 --> 08:32.400
portion of the meeting.

08:32.400 --> 08:42.000
So we're fine proceeding with the video.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.040
AC GORDON: Okay, great, great.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.840
So we'll go ahead and do the video

08:44.840 --> 08:48.800
and then we'll do the meeting minutes
from the prior meeting.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.760
So before
we actually get into the business portion,

08:52.840 --> 08:57.480
we wanted to properly give time and space

08:57.480 --> 09:02.000
to honor our former Chairman
and remember him in

09:02.000 --> 09:06.280
this space.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.320
His unexpected and untimely

09:10.320 --> 09:12.760
passing

09:12.760 --> 09:14.160
happened on December 1st

09:14.160 --> 09:17.800
and really impacted all of us greatly.

09:17.880 --> 09:23.760
Our hearts were really saddened
and I'm sure by the participants as well

09:23.840 --> 09:26.800
who had the privilege of knowing him,

09:26.880 --> 09:27.800
and many of

09:27.800 --> 09:31.480
us have struggled with his passing

09:31.560 --> 09:35.680
and we are still grieving.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.000
His loss for us and still very raw.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.840
It's a huge loss
for the disability community

09:42.920 --> 09:48.800
and the disability movement.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.080
He was an amazing lawyer,

09:51.080 --> 09:56.000
leader, mentor, friend to many of us

09:56.080 --> 09:59.600
and we're fortunate
to have been able to work with him.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.120
Unfortunately, not long enough.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.720
I was really looking forward
to his mentorship and learning from him

10:05.800 --> 10:11.080
and that unfortunately was cut short.

10:11.160 --> 10:17.440
So now we want to play this video.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.960
We want to go ahead
and show the video of this tribute

10:19.960 --> 10:25.280
that was put together
by one of our staff members.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.400
Nick,
thank you so much, Nick, for everything

10:28.400 --> 10:32.160
that you invested in getting this video
developed

10:32.240 --> 10:35.640
to properly honor Andrés,

10:35.720 --> 10:39.800
who inspires us
and has contributed so much.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.560
So Miss Lewis as well,
if you wouldn't mind, go ahead.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.760
Thank you.
Go ahead and play the video.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.480
I was honored to be designated as Chairman

10:50.480 --> 10:53.920
of the National Council on Disability.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.680
I am a Hispanic male with fair

10:55.680 --> 10:59.680
complexion, exceedingly
gray hair, black framed glasses,

10:59.760 --> 11:05.040
and I am a proud member of the disability
community Class of 1996,

11:05.120 --> 11:08.480
having sustained a spinal cord injury
resulting in quadriplegia

11:08.480 --> 11:11.800
in an automobile accident.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.520
As a person with a spinal cord injury,
I, like so many others,

11:15.600 --> 11:19.240
have experienced the realities
of trying to attain medical care

11:19.320 --> 11:22.760
while confronting the seismic barriers
that still exist

11:22.760 --> 11:27.120
despite the over 30 years
since the Americans with Disabilities Act

11:27.200 --> 11:29.040
became law,

11:29.040 --> 11:32.840
so many of us have stories to tell.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.440
Sir, you wrote the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.880
That's a big friggin deal.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.400
Gentlemen,
the National Council on Disability,

11:42.400 --> 11:46.000
with nine Presidentially
and Congressionally appointed members,

11:46.080 --> 11:49.840
carries a statutory mission
to advise the President,

11:49.920 --> 11:52.760
his administration, Congress and federal

11:52.760 --> 11:58.480
agencies on all policy matters impacting
people with disabilities. The health

11:58.480 --> 12:02.960
and well-being of people with disabilities
have long been ignored in this country.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.520
This occurs despite the existence

12:05.520 --> 12:10.440
of an overwhelming body of studies
and reports that unequivocally document

12:10.520 --> 12:14.800
the significant and continuing
prevalence of health disparities that

12:14.880 --> 12:18.800
exist between people with disabilities
and our non-disabled counterparts.

12:18.840 --> 12:23.880
The National Council on Disability
was fighting for federal legislation

12:23.960 --> 12:28.200
to protect the rights of persons with disabilities

12:28.280 --> 12:31.280
since its inception. NCD has worked to develop

12:31.320 --> 12:35.960
a health equity framework
to provide policymakers in Congress

12:36.040 --> 12:40.000
and in the administration with a blueprint
to take action.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.720
The adoption of enforceable medical
diagnostic equipment standards

12:43.800 --> 12:49.320
is just one step towards health equity
for persons with mobility disabilities

12:49.400 --> 12:54.720
and is just one component of NCD's
pursuit of health equity for all people

12:54.840 --> 12:59.960
with disabilities--for an all of government
approach to address health disparities.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.240
The framework was one year
in the making with the input of our

13:03.240 --> 13:07.600
then-Council members, members
of the disability community and a dream

13:07.600 --> 13:11.640
team of 14 advisors
comprised of health care disparities

13:11.640 --> 13:15.880
researchers, physicians
caring for people with disabilities,

13:15.960 --> 13:19.440
health care and disability law professors,
among others.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.240
It's a matter of attaining
and maintaining good health.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.760
It's critically

13:23.760 --> 13:28.160
important for everyone, but more so for persons with disabilities.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.680
It's truly the predicate to our ability to live, our ability to learn,

13:32.760 --> 13:38.080
and our ability to work and earn. Into the forefront of discussions

13:38.080 --> 13:42.840
that are taking place in medical schools
and perhaps at the associations here.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.960
I have to impart with
your, our house is on fire.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.080
The issues that we're

13:48.080 --> 13:52.400
talking about here, when individuals like me

13:52.480 --> 13:55.320
can't get weighed at medical appointments
because there's

13:55.320 --> 13:58.320
no wheelchair accessible weight skills,
when we don't get transferred

13:58.440 --> 14:02.560
onto examination tables
for full physical examination

14:02.640 --> 14:07.040
because of the inability
or the unwillingness of providers to do so.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.640
And then we see a heightened percentage
of people with spinal cord injuries

14:11.720 --> 14:16.280
and mobility disabilities being diagnosed
with colon cancer because they're simply

14:16.280 --> 14:20.640
not being checked or prostate cancer
because they're simply not being checked.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.000
We don't have time for polite

14:24.080 --> 14:27.800
conversations in your respective schools.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.200
We need some action,
and that has to happen.

14:31.200 --> 14:37.880
And so I impart to you
that our house is on fire

14:37.960 --> 14:46.280
and these issues need resolution.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.200
Let's remember that

14:47.200 --> 14:51.760
disability is a natural part of the human condition.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.200
Let us

14:52.200 --> 14:56.640
remember that disability is not a characteristic that stands alone,

14:56.720 --> 15:00.080
but it is one that intersects
with all other aspects

15:00.320 --> 15:04.880
of a person's identity,
such as age, race, ethnicity,

15:04.960 --> 15:09.880
income level, sexual orientation,
gender identity and religion.

15:09.960 --> 15:14.440
Let us recommit to shaping a future
in which all members of this beautiful

15:14.440 --> 15:18.240
community can have and enjoy full rights,

15:18.320 --> 15:20.680
free from discrimination

15:20.680 --> 15:23.960
to live self-directed, independent lives.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.720
To achieve our full potential.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.000
Achieving our full potential is only possible

15:30.080 --> 15:57.040
if we're able to attain and maintain good health.

15:57.120 --> 16:04.880
AC GORDON: That was beautiful.

16:04.960 --> 16:11.520
Interpreters, Are we ready?

16:11.600 --> 16:12.160
For people

16:12.160 --> 16:15.160
who are relying on the interpretation,

16:15.280 --> 16:19.200
we have Samantha,
who is currently signing.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.040
So if you want to go ahead
and pin the interpreter, please do so.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.640
I'm actually signing right now
so you can pin me.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.200
But if you need the interpreter later,
I just want to say thank you to Nick

16:30.200 --> 16:33.440
and the staff for pulling
such an amazing video together.

16:33.440 --> 16:37.520
Such an amazing tribute to honor Andrés Gallegos.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.920
Before I move forward with other business,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.200
I wanted to mention one other thing related to Andrés.

16:44.200 --> 16:48.920
An announcement to make.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.240
Before we make the announcement.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.920
I’d like to ask my fellow Council members
if anyone had any brief remarks

16:55.000 --> 16:59.520
that they wanted to make about Andrés
or to share any words about Andrés

16:59.520 --> 17:04.360
before we proceeded with business,
I'd like to give the floor to you.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.960
CM BITTNER: I had some remarks

17:08.040 --> 17:10.560
Are you ready?

17:10.560 --> 17:13.560
AC GORDON: Please, please go ahead, Sascha.

17:13.560 --> 17:21.240
CM BITTNER: One second.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.720
Andrés was such an amazing, dedicated man.

17:36.840 --> 17:42.640
with a clear vision for

17:47.040 --> 17:51.800
what he wanted the Council to accomplish

17:56.280 --> 17:59.720
on behalf of disabled Americans.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.280
is leadership, passion, and sense of urgency

18:02.280 --> 18:06.240
regarding  the critical responsibility with which we have been tasked

18:06.320 --> 18:09.800
has  motivated and inspired all of us on the Council.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.680
Andrés not only  possessed a sweeping understanding of the challenges

18:13.680 --> 18:18.040
facing our  community and the policy changes needed to address them,

18:18.120 --> 18:23.240
but was also just so personally kind, funny, generous and supportive.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.800
When I was sworn on to the Council and acknowledged

18:25.800 --> 18:29.560
all those who  had made it possible for me to get to this point,

18:29.640 --> 18:34.720
I referred to them as my team.  Andrés warmly welcomed me to the Council.

18:34.760 --> 18:39.040
I was deeply touched when he said he was now a
member of Team Sasha too.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.440
Andrés strongly encouraged me to use my time on the Council

18:42.440 --> 18:45.400
to uplift the issues I find important.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.360
Even though I knew him

18:53.080 --> 18:54.480
for such a short time,

18:58.240 --> 19:00.040
I will always consider him a mentor.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.560
And will do my best

19:06.920 --> 19:09.360
to live up to his example.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.680
Thank you.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.480
AC GORDON: Thank you so much, Sascha.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.480
Before we continue,
what anyone else, fellow Council members,

19:43.680 --> 19:47.760
are there any of the comments or words
to share regarding our former Chairman

19:47.760 --> 19:51.400
Andrés, before we proceed?

19:51.480 --> 19:53.640
CM BRADDY: This is Theo

19:53.640 --> 19:57.520
I completely agree with everything  Sascha just stated

19:57.600 --> 20:01.680
He was a kind, gentle man

20:01.680 --> 20:05.320
who just continued to  pursue his objectives

20:05.320 --> 20:10.560
in a way that he demonstrated power but yet a  great kind of gentleness.

20:10.560 --> 20:19.560
And I just appreciated that in him, and he  will thoroughly be missed.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.840
AC GORDON: Thank you so much, Theo.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.000
Anything else from the Council?

20:25.080 --> 20:26.240
If not,

20:26.240 --> 20:32.440
Then the last order
or the last thing I'd like to say--

20:32.520 --> 20:35.440
there are some accessibility issues.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.880
For anyone who needs the  interpreters,

20:38.960 --> 20:42.160
please go ahead and pin the interpreters.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.280
The current interpreter

20:43.280 --> 20:47.880
is Samantha.  I, Claudia Gordon,

20:47.880 --> 20:52.080
am also a signer and I am  signing right now.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.280
So you can pin me as well.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.880
But also, in regards

20:56.880 --> 21:01.000
to Andrés, I am pleased to announce that the Executive Committee met

21:01.000 --> 21:05.960
and had a discussion about how we can best honor Andrés' legacy

21:06.040 --> 21:09.480
just to ensure that we continue his work

21:09.480 --> 21:12.720
and his commitment to health equity.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.320
So we have decided to establish

21:16.400 --> 21:19.720
a new NCD award

21:19.800 --> 21:24.240
in memory of Andrés and it's called the

21:24.240 --> 21:28.360
Andrés Gallegos  Health Care Access Award.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.480
And this is to honor his memory.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.960
With this particular award,

21:33.960 --> 21:38.720
we intend to regularly recognize

21:38.800 --> 21:42.560
and also elevate attention

21:42.640 --> 21:46.040
towards individuals and institutions,

21:46.280 --> 21:49.480
as well as organizations

21:49.560 --> 21:52.880
that are making a significant contribution

21:52.960 --> 21:57.080
to this particular
cause for more equitable

21:57.080 --> 22:06.360
health care for persons with disabilities.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.120
And as you well know,

22:08.120 --> 22:11.560
I don't have to tell you
you're eyewitnesses to the fact that

22:11.680 --> 22:16.880
Andrés’ greatest passion
was this particular issue.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.080
And I know the moment he was selected

22:19.080 --> 22:22.560
Chair of this Council,

22:22.640 --> 22:25.200
that this would be his work.

22:25.200 --> 22:29.160
And we've seen a lot of progress
to his credit,

22:29.240 --> 22:35.720
because of his investment and leadership
and his passion.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.920
So I'm very excited

22:37.920 --> 22:41.840
that we are
starting this award in his honor.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.120
And it demonstrates NCD's

22:45.200 --> 22:50.120
unwavering commitment to his work
going forward.

22:50.200 --> 22:55.200
So we'd like to honor
the first recipient this year.

22:55.280 --> 22:59.080
So you will be hearing more about this
and the process

22:59.160 --> 23:03.880
for nominations
and voting and selection as well.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.000
So to wrap this

23:06.000 --> 23:11.320
segment up, I want to say again, Andrés
we will miss you.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.320
You are with us in spirit.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.040
Your legacy continues

23:16.040 --> 23:19.520
through our work
and through your individual efforts

23:19.760 --> 23:23.120
and the organizations that you represent

23:23.120 --> 23:27.560
as well.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.680
Now we will turn our attention

23:30.680 --> 23:33.960
to business matters of the Council

23:34.040 --> 23:40.280
and I would like to call for approval
for the meeting.

23:40.280 --> 23:45.600
minutes from November 16th and 17th,
our Council meeting

23:45.600 --> 23:50.080
that took place in Providence,
Rhode Island,

23:50.160 --> 23:52.040
that was November 16th and 17.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.200
So I'd like to ask for a motion

23:54.200 --> 23:57.680
to could we have a motion
from a fellow council member?

23:57.760 --> 24:02.320
CM BITTNER: I move.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.280
AC GORDON: Okay.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.760
Thank you, Sasha.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.760
And can I have a second?

24:08.000 --> 24:08.600
CM VOORDE: I second.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.760
This is Emily.

24:12.840 --> 24:13.480
AC GORDON: All right.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.280
Thank you, Emily.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.080
Now we'll go over
and turn this over to Ms..

24:18.080 --> 24:23.600
Lewis for the roll call vote.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.400
LEWIS: Thank you.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.040
Calling on Vice Chair,

24:30.120 --> 24:31.440
Acting Chair,

24:31.440 --> 24:41.640
Madam Claudia Gordon.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.280
AC GORDON: Yes.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.160
LEWIS: Hoskie Benally?

24:49.320 --> 24:51.120
Sascha Bittner?
CM BITTNER: Yes.

24:51.120 --> 24:55.520
LEWIS: Theo Braddy?
CM BRADDY: Yes.

24:55.600 --> 25:02.000
LEWIS: Noting that Shawn Kennemer is not present.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.480
Risa Rifkind?
CM RIFKIND: Yes.

25:05.040 --> 25:09.640
AC GORDON: Ms. Lewis, I am proxy for Shawn,
so I will go ahead and aye that.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.000
Okay, great.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.320
LEWIS: Neil Romano
CM Romano: Aye.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.920
LEWIS: And lastly, Emily Voorde.
CM VOORDE: Aye.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.040
LEWIS: Thank you.

25:26.040 --> 25:29.000
I yield the floor back to you Vice Chair,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Acting Chair,

25:30.000 --> 25:35.040
Madam Claudia Gordon.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.360
AC GORDON: I just want to announce
that we did have an interpreter switch.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.640
Vern is now the interpreter,

25:43.720 --> 25:44.840
and Claudia Gordon

25:44.840 --> 25:49.280
is speaking through an interpreter
offscreen.

25:49.360 --> 25:54.040
Now we'll go on to the next order of
business, which is the financial report.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.720
Our financial report

25:56.720 --> 25:59.720
lead is Shawn, who is not here today.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.880
So on his behalf,
we will have a staff member,

26:04.000 --> 26:10.600
Keith Woods,
provide and deliver Shawn's report.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.880
So we'll go ahead

26:11.880 --> 26:15.960
and take a vote for that to have
that approved

26:16.040 --> 26:21.120
the status of funds for December
31, 2023.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.560
Keith I'll go ahead and turn it over to you.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.040
KEITH WOODS: Thank you, Madam Acting Chair.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.560
Our current spending is in alignment with our C.R. budget

26:30.880 --> 26:34.360
NCD spent $826,634.

26:34.440 --> 26:39.840
of the $1,314,775 through December 31, 2023.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.880
Our current C.R.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.800
goes through February 2nd, 2024.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.800
We're right on track and awaiting a full budget

26:45.800 --> 26:49.360
so we can properly forecast the remainder of the fiscal year.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.080
Currently we're in the process of downgrading our office space

26:52.080 --> 26:57.960
which will reduce our rent from $21,848 to $11,320 a month.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.640
This will save the organization $73,696

27:00.640 --> 27:04.360
in this fiscal year.

27:04.440 --> 27:08.520
As always, we conservatively budgeted
1% of the budget to anti-deficiency

27:08.520 --> 27:13.680
line item to avoid the agency becoming anti-deficient.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.960
Key takeaways from the status

27:14.960 --> 27:18.960
of funds: NCD is on track and spent 63% of the C.R.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.920
budget through December 31, 2023.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
To date, no funds have been spent
on policy projects.

27:26.120 --> 27:29.640
A lot of the policy work
is going to be done in-house.

27:29.720 --> 27:35.480
NCD is going to save $73,696 this year through the downsizing of the office space.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.960
And we received that new C.R.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.520
budget

27:38.520 --> 27:41.840
through March 8, 2024, and a new amount

27:41.840 --> 27:46.520
would be $1,682,835.

27:46.600 --> 27:50.360
Madam Acting Chair,
would you like to motion and a vote

27:50.360 --> 27:55.320
to approve the status of funds through December 31, 2023?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.120
AC GORDON: This is Madam Chair.

27:57.120 --> 28:01.480
Yes, I move

28:02.080 --> 28:05.680
if it's appropriate, I can move to have this motion.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.680
I can make this motion.

28:07.680 --> 28:14.920
Do we have a motion?
CM ROMANO: So moved.

28:15.000 --> 28:15.400
AC GORDON: Okay.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.680
Thank you, Neil. Do we have a second?

28:18.760 --> 28:22.800
CM BITTNER:  I'll second it.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.280
AC GORDON: Okay.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.160
Perfect.

28:24.160 --> 28:24.960
Thank you, Neil.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.960
And thank you, Sascha.

28:28.120 --> 28:33.760
We'll do a quick vote.
LEWIS: Calling on Vice Chair,

28:33.840 --> 28:40.280
Acting Chair Madam Claudia Gordon?

28:40.360 --> 28:49.560
AC GORDON: Aye. Yes.
LEWIS: Hoskie Benally?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.360
Okay, we're still having issues with Mr.

28:52.360 --> 28:57.280
Benally. Sascha Bittner?
CM BITTNER: Yes.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.920
LEWIS: Theo Braddy?
CM BRADDY: Yes.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.520
LEWIS: Shawn Kennemer?

29:02.520 --> 29:10.120
His proxy?

29:10.200 --> 29:13.840
AC GORDON: Aye. Yes.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.880
LEWIS: Risa Rifkind?
CM RIFKIND: Aye.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.840
LEWIS: Neil Romano?
CM ROMANO: Aye.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.840
LEWIS: And lastly, Emily Voorde.
CM VOORDE: Aye.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.440
LEWIS: I yield the floor back to you

29:26.440 --> 29:28.840
Vice Chair Acting Chair.

29:28.840 --> 29:37.040
Madam Claudia Gordon.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.000
AC GORDON: Okay.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.920
Thank you. Perfect.

29:40.920 --> 29:45.360
Thank you, Keith,
for your report of the status of funds.

29:45.440 --> 29:50.000
And that's been approved by the Council.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.320
Now as Acting Chair,

29:53.400 --> 29:55.720
I know we've lost a lot of time

29:55.720 --> 29:58.720
with the troubleshooting
some access issues,

29:58.720 --> 30:03.880
so I'm going to kind of condense my report
to make up for time that was lost.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.520
I'd like to thank
everyone for their patience

30:07.600 --> 30:08.440
and thank you to

30:08.440 --> 30:12.120
the Council members
for your patience as well

30:12.200 --> 30:18.640
and helping us troubleshoot this issue.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.840
I think it's appropriate

30:19.840 --> 30:23.160
at the top of my remarks as vice chair

30:23.160 --> 30:30.280
for this report,

30:30.360 --> 30:32.160
just to share some staff updates

30:32.160 --> 30:38.640
that were shared with me earlier this week.

30:38.720 --> 30:44.040
Later this month,

30:44.120 --> 30:45.600
a longtime staff

30:45.600 --> 30:50.880
member will be departing NCD.

30:50.960 --> 30:56.760
Lisa has been with us for many years.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.520
This is Lisa Grubb

30:58.520 --> 31:02.280
and will be leaving her role

31:02.360 --> 31:04.840
to retirement.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.760
And unfortunately
this is due to some health issues.

31:07.760 --> 31:13.240
So I think it's important to take a moment
publicly to recognize Lisa

31:13.320 --> 31:16.280
and to thank her for her contributions

31:16.280 --> 31:22.120
to NCD over her tenure.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.960
Lisa has worked with NCD twice

31:24.960 --> 31:30.880
in two separate
capacities, in two separate terms

31:30.960 --> 31:35.800
in 2007 to November of 2012,

31:35.880 --> 31:43.760
and then again July 2014 to the present.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.360
She has been promoted

31:45.360 --> 31:48.360
several times during her tenure

31:48.360 --> 31:51.760
with the Council

31:51.840 --> 31:58.240
and also served as executive director

31:58.320 --> 32:04.840
under former Chair Neil Romano.

32:04.920 --> 32:09.080
And this was during

32:09.160 --> 32:12.040
the previous administration.

32:12.040 --> 32:23.920
I'd like to ask members of the team

32:24.000 --> 32:24.960
to give thanks

32:24.960 --> 32:30.760
because Lisa has really been operational
in helping us establish so many

32:30.840 --> 32:34.360
factors here at NCD,
helping us get compliant

32:34.360 --> 32:38.240
with federal regulations.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.520
And we are a small agency.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.640
So those successes
and those accomplishments,

32:43.640 --> 32:47.360
that Lisa has done have been very

32:47.440 --> 32:51.440
essential to the function of NCD.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.360
And Lisa is here with us today.

32:54.360 --> 32:58.120
And I'd just like to say on behalf
of our fellow Council members

32:58.200 --> 33:04.080
and myself, thank you
tremendously for your public service

33:04.160 --> 33:06.960
to the American people

33:06.960 --> 33:18.240
throughout your time at NCD.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.880
If we could give Lisa a round of applause.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.800
Lisa Grubb,

33:23.800 --> 33:27.440
Thank you very much.

33:27.520 --> 33:31.400
The other thing that I wanted to mention,

33:31.480 --> 33:34.440
I wanted to recognize a staff member

33:34.440 --> 33:38.000
at NCD who has been working so hard to transition

33:38.000 --> 33:43.240
the agency’s website,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.280
A lot of reports, a lot of material and publications

33:46.280 --> 33:50.640
that had to be uploaded
and made web accessible.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.720
It was a huge undertaking

33:53.840 --> 33:58.560
and that was done by my Nick Sabula.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.920
So I want to thank Nick for demonstrating

34:02.920 --> 34:10.600
such great leadership in this effort.

34:10.680 --> 34:12.000
This started with first

34:12.000 --> 34:15.680
assessing our accessibility of our website

34:15.760 --> 34:18.640
with Neil as well,

34:18.640 --> 34:24.080
and Nick was able to take on that work
and keep forging ahead with it.

34:24.160 --> 34:27.120
And finally, it has been completed

34:27.120 --> 34:31.480
and I just want to recognize Nick
for all of his efforts

34:31.560 --> 34:35.040
in getting the website,
the new website up and running.

34:35.040 --> 34:41.560
So we can also applaud that.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.840
Now, in my role as the

34:42.840 --> 34:49.040
acting chair and vice chair

34:49.120 --> 34:55.240
I will direct you towards Anne and the staff.

34:55.320 --> 35:00.000
I think it's important that we continue
to focus on the work that we talked about

35:00.000 --> 35:03.400
earlier from former Chair Andrés Gallegos

35:03.480 --> 35:07.600
and make health equity a priority

35:07.680 --> 35:11.240
during the rest of my term here at NCD.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.160
Many of you are aware of emerging issues

35:15.200 --> 35:19.000
within the executive branch

35:19.080 --> 35:22.360
and possible changes on how they count.

35:22.360 --> 35:27.800
folks with disabilities.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.760
We did have a meeting
with the executive branch.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.680
It was a very productive meeting

35:33.680 --> 35:36.960
with the Census Bureau

35:37.040 --> 35:42.960
and our concerns were proposed

35:43.040 --> 35:46.280
and it was great
to be able to hear from them

35:46.280 --> 35:50.200
and you will hear from them later
on during this meeting today.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.840
A lot of positive changes are coming forth

35:52.840 --> 35:56.080
this week and I'm really grateful
to the partnership.

35:56.120 --> 36:00.600
We are really grateful to the partnership
because they heard our voices.

36:00.600 --> 36:10.080
Your voices.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.760
Oher issues.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.800
We are reviewing some proposals

36:15.800 --> 36:18.800
for future meetings,

36:18.840 --> 36:26.280
virtual and in-person.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.880
What policies should we address
for the upcoming year?

36:29.960 --> 36:33.600
As we are approaching the May meeting?

36:33.680 --> 36:35.840
There will be a time for us

36:35.840 --> 36:40.120
to vote on the issues
that we want to bring up.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.640
So I've asked the fellow Council members

36:43.720 --> 36:48.000
to start engaging with each of us,

36:48.080 --> 36:51.080
each of our respective communities,
to get a pulse

36:51.080 --> 36:54.600
on what are some timely

36:54.680 --> 36:57.880
issues that we should prioritize

36:57.960 --> 37:00.600
as a council

37:00.600 --> 37:03.200
that we can focus on

37:03.200 --> 37:05.760
perhaps for the May meeting
and going forward.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.760
So I encourage my fellow Council members
to engage with your communities

37:09.760 --> 37:12.760
and bring back the ideas and suggestions

37:12.760 --> 37:17.320
and potential policy priorities
that we can address

37:17.320 --> 37:28.160
as a council and bring those
forward for the May meeting.

37:28.240 --> 37:32.440
We also talked about funding.

37:32.520 --> 37:35.160
We haven't had consistent funding.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.440
We have continuing resolutions
and it's been hard

37:37.440 --> 37:42.320
to kind of plan our meetings in person
because we're not always sure we have the

37:42.400 --> 37:45.480
right amount of funds
available to support travel

37:45.720 --> 37:49.000
and everything else
that comes along with in-person meetings.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.760
We're still not sure what future meetings,

37:52.840 --> 37:57.480
if we’ll be able to host them in-person,
but we are exploring the possibility

37:57.480 --> 38:01.800
of having a smaller connect
where we are able to go out

38:01.800 --> 38:06.040
and reach the community
instead of having the entire Council.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.040
And that was something that Andrés
really wanted,

38:09.040 --> 38:12.800
specifically
in visiting Indigenous land as well.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.480
So we'll talk more about that
as we discuss

38:15.480 --> 38:20.000
this more internally as a council.

38:20.080 --> 38:27.680
Let me see if I missed anything.

38:27.760 --> 38:38.800
I think my report

38:38.880 --> 38:41.880
might be done.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.280
I will give it over

38:44.280 --> 38:47.800
to the Council members
to provide any brief comments.

38:47.880 --> 38:54.120
If we can do a time check regarding
any activities that your communities--

38:54.200 --> 38:54.600
you’ve engaged in

38:54.600 --> 38:58.280
with your communities since November
that you’d like to share with the Council

38:58.360 --> 39:03.000
or things that you were hearing
or picking up within the communities?

39:03.080 --> 39:08.480
EX DIR SOMMERS MCINTOSH: Madam Chair,

39:08.560 --> 39:11.160
I apologize,
this is Ann Sommers McIntosh.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.760
I apologize for interrupting.

39:12.760 --> 39:17.760
We inadvertently skipped our governance
report during the executive committee,

39:17.840 --> 39:21.280
and I have been advised
that we do need to return to that

39:21.280 --> 39:26.000
to memorialize the financial votes
of the executive committee.

39:26.080 --> 39:29.280
So if we can do that briefly
before we return

39:29.440 --> 39:32.880
to the community report
outs from the Council members,

39:32.960 --> 39:38.600
the governance report
will be provided by Sascha Bittner.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.560
AC GORDON: Sascha, you have the floor.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.360
CM BITTNER:

39:46.440 --> 39:48.000
Council members.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.560
as the Governance Chair.

39:57.840 --> 40:01.480
I'm  required to memorialize for the record

40:07.200 --> 40:10.080
Any votes taken by the full Council.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.440
Between Council meetings.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.040
For the record.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.080
I am memorializing.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.920
The electronic vote.

40:34.920 --> 40:39.760
Of the National Council on Disability.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.000
To close this meeting

40:49.920 --> 40:52.680
at the conclusion of the public portion

40:52.680 --> 40:56.440
of the meeting.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.080
For a short period.

41:06.840 --> 41:10.080
Pursuant to the exceptions, the Sunshine Act.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.040
And I am also memorializing.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.360
For the record.

41:25.640 --> 41:30.200
The online vote.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.560
Of the council.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.840
To approve the continuing resolution
budget.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Through February 2nd, 2024,

41:53.720 --> 41:54.160
Thank you.

41:54.160 --> 42:26.120
And I'm done.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.480
AC GORDON: All right,

42:27.480 --> 42:30.800
So if there is no vote required,

42:30.880 --> 42:35.960
we will return to where we left off
in our agenda with Council members.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.840
The floor is open to you to share briefly
about your engagements and interactions

42:39.840 --> 42:47.040
with your respective communities.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.200
Who wants to start?

42:48.200 --> 42:50.200
So don't make me call on someone.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.960
CM BRADDY: I'll be happy to go.

42:51.960 --> 42:52.960
AC GORDON: Theo I see you.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.880
I saw you at the White House.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.880
CM BRADDY: Yeah. We had a great time.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.360
We had a really good time.

42:58.360 --> 43:01.920
Thank  you for coming up and tapping me.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.600
Okay, a

43:03.600 --> 43:05.160
couple of things.

43:05.160 --> 43:10.000
And actually,
you sort of brought this up, Madam Chair,

43:10.080 --> 43:10.920
in regard to.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.040
I brought this up before.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.840
Before, and it didn't get approved,
but I'm still hearing

43:16.920 --> 43:20.120
about disability equity education.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.240
Right.

43:22.240 --> 43:24.000
I still believe and I'm hearing

43:24.000 --> 43:27.760
from a lot of people
that ableism is our greatest challenge.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.120
Right.

43:28.120 --> 43:31.440
And it affects us in all kinds of areas,
in walks

43:31.440 --> 43:34.480
of life, education, health care.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.640
We all have been talking about that
transportation,

43:36.640 --> 43:38.960
housing, ableism affect all of that.

43:38.960 --> 43:44.320
And one of the things that we did here in
Pennsylvania was in 2003,

43:44.400 --> 43:48.720
we got a curriculum, the disability
inclusive curriculum passed.

43:48.720 --> 43:51.720
And and it started in 2003
as a great product.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.920
It was a great model.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.360
I suggested prior year ago that we we
we bring it

43:56.400 --> 44:00.640
and make it one of our proposed projects
to try to make it statewide.

44:00.720 --> 44:05.120
And so again, I'm just hearing a lot about

44:05.200 --> 44:06.720
how important

44:06.720 --> 44:09.720
it is to eradicate ableism.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.000
And it is again,
it's our greatest challenge.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.520
So in order to address it,
we need to start early

44:14.520 --> 44:16.440
and we certainly need to start in schools.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.160
Right.

44:17.160 --> 44:20.640
And so, again, I just wanted to report

44:20.720 --> 44:22.920
about the disability equality

44:22.920 --> 44:25.920
in education curriculum and how important it is

44:26.160 --> 44:29.560
and how we should work toward
making that a national model.

44:29.640 --> 44:34.480
For all the good work, I want to shout out
to Alan Holdsworth and Lisa Aquila

44:34.480 --> 44:40.000
in Pennsylvania for getting that done
and hopefully I can bring it up again.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.440
So we Council can consider it.

44:42.440 --> 44:56.200
Thank you.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.520
AC GORDON: Thank you Theo.

44:58.520 --> 45:01.040
Greatly appreciate your update.

45:01.040 --> 45:06.840
Anyone else, any other council members like to take a moment or two to share

45:06.920 --> 45:08.240
CM BITTNER:  I have a report.

45:08.240 --> 45:13.040
Annika, do you want to read part of it for me.

45:16.680 --> 45:20.600
Since our last meeting in November,
I have been doing my usual work

45:20.600 --> 45:23.680
as previously shared, especially advocacy

45:23.680 --> 45:27.040
on behalf of home
care providers and employers

45:27.120 --> 45:31.080
and self-determination for people
with developmental disabilities.

45:31.160 --> 45:35.080
There is a new development in California
I would like to highlight

45:35.160 --> 45:38.360
since we are dealing with a huge budgetary
shortfall,

45:38.440 --> 45:42.360
our governor is proposing
delaying the pay increases

45:42.360 --> 45:47.800
for direct support personnel who work
with people with intellectual disabilities

45:47.880 --> 45:52.960
and developmental disabilities that were
supposed to be implemented this year.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.520
According to the California Community
Living Network,

45:56.600 --> 45:59.880
a developmental disability policy advocacy

45:59.880 --> 46:04.920
nonprofit, the state's own 2019
rate study showed

46:05.000 --> 46:10.160
California was underfunding the system
by $1.8 billion,

46:10.240 --> 46:14.240
which makes this proposed
delay in implementation very concerning.

46:17.640 --> 46:18.960
It, certainly won't help.

46:23.400 --> 46:24.960
The existing long delays.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.080
In needed services.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.200
That people with developmental disabilities face.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.480
When they need to see their caseworkers.

46:50.640 --> 46:51.360
And that is all.

46:51.360 --> 46:59.800
Thank you.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.640
AC GORDON: Yes, thank you.

47:07.640 --> 47:10.640
Sasha. Anyone else?

47:10.680 --> 47:11.320
CM ROMANO:  Madam Chair?

47:11.320 --> 47:18.400
Neil Romano

47:18.480 --> 47:19.200
AC GORDON: Go ahead, Neil.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.360
Thank you.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.600
CM ROMANO:  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.160
Still, as always,

47:25.160 --> 47:29.080
in my area, employment still is an issue.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.720
Employment of people with disabilities.

47:30.720 --> 47:33.960
There is a great fear
that even though employment has trended

47:33.960 --> 47:38.600
well in the last few years for people
with disabilities, we still have

47:38.680 --> 47:43.120
a lack of understanding
in the area of sheltered workshops,

47:43.200 --> 47:46.200
especially in some of the areas
that relate to tax policy,

47:46.200 --> 47:48.760
which we'll talk about a great deal
further.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.240
That's one area
that just never seems to go away,

47:51.240 --> 47:54.640
finding people that are continuously.

47:54.840 --> 47:58.560
Recently
did a film with an organization about 14 C

47:58.560 --> 48:03.240
and it appears to even by some of the
standards of the Department of Labor,

48:03.320 --> 48:06.720
has seemed to creep up a little bit more,
something we always have

48:06.720 --> 48:07.760
to keep an eye on.

48:07.760 --> 48:11.040
The second thing is
an independent insurance

48:11.040 --> 48:15.640
agency, group
group insurance out in the West

48:15.720 --> 48:16.760
discovered that

48:16.760 --> 48:21.080
many people with disabilities,
especially people who are blind

48:21.080 --> 48:24.520
and or Deaf, are not aware of

48:24.600 --> 48:27.600
anything
beyond the Social Security benefits,

48:27.600 --> 48:31.920
the Medicare and Medicaid benefits
that could be available to them.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.960
And it's primarily
because of a lack of information

48:37.080 --> 48:40.720
and a lack of having
any interpreting services

48:40.800 --> 48:45.400
for people to deal with people in
just about every field.

48:45.480 --> 48:52.200
So that is a continuing problem, but
very significant, especially for people

48:52.200 --> 48:56.280
who are Deaf and blind,
who are reporting rates of not knowing

48:56.280 --> 48:59.280
anything beyond Social Security

48:59.360 --> 49:02.360
in the 75 to 95% ratio.

49:02.600 --> 49:05.920
So it's something to take,
you know, consider,

49:06.000 --> 49:10.240
you know, having agencies
look at how they give information

49:10.320 --> 49:20.480
beyond just written thank you.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.720
AC GORDON: Thank you.

49:21.720 --> 49:24.320
Thank you, Neil.

49:24.320 --> 49:28.920
I see Emily and then we'll go to Risa.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.720
Please go ahead, Emily.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.680
CM VOORDE: Thank you so much, Madam Chair.

49:35.680 --> 49:39.480
Vice chair, this is Emily Voorde speaking.

49:39.560 --> 49:43.560
The issue that I have heard most

49:43.640 --> 49:46.640
discussed since our last Council meeting

49:46.680 --> 49:51.880
has been access to the vote and

49:51.960 --> 49:55.360
instances of voter suppression in states

49:55.440 --> 49:58.920
across the country by

49:59.000 --> 50:01.840
states and parties, but also,

50:01.840 --> 50:06.320
you know, direct suppression
of the vote of persons with disabilities.

50:06.400 --> 50:12.160
And a recent report
from Rutgers University

50:12.240 --> 50:15.560
found that 14% of voters with disabilities

50:15.640 --> 50:19.720
had some difficulty voting in 2022.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.720
We also know

50:22.720 --> 50:26.400
that eight states do elections

50:26.400 --> 50:30.360
entirely by mail, 28 states offer no excuse absentee voting.

50:30.560 --> 50:36.000
The rest of states provide, necessitate that you provide an excuse

50:36.080 --> 50:40.160
to qualify for absentee mail ballots.

50:40.240 --> 50:43.640
The lack of access to those absentee

50:43.720 --> 50:46.720
voting to that absentee
voting and voting by mail

50:46.960 --> 50:52.120
is significantly inhibiting access
to the votes, whether that be

50:52.120 --> 50:55.120
participation in municipal, local elections,

50:55.320 --> 50:57.920
or state and federal elections.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.320
Given the impending

51:00.320 --> 51:04.320
election cycle and the presidential

51:04.400 --> 51:04.880
primaries

51:04.880 --> 51:09.280
currently occurring, the federal election,
the general forthcoming,

51:09.360 --> 51:11.760
this is of great concern

51:11.760 --> 51:15.920
to communities
with disabilities, particularly mine here

51:16.000 --> 51:20.240
in Indiana, in the Midwest.

51:20.320 --> 51:22.480
So something I wanted to raise
and that I hope

51:22.480 --> 51:25.680
we're able to address further, discuss further in future meetings.

51:32.880 --> 51:36.920
AC GORDON: Thank you, Emily, for bringing up that issue.

51:37.000 --> 51:37.880
I believe we have.

51:37.880 --> 51:43.080
Risa, do you have anything you'd like
to add from your your brief interactions

51:43.080 --> 51:45.600
in thecommunity?
Don't mean to put you on the spot.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.320
CM RIFKIND: Not at all.

51:46.320 --> 51:50.680
I knew it was coming on the agenda and I'm happy to report out.

51:50.760 --> 51:55.640
But I am happy Emily went before me
because I was also going to bring up,

51:55.720 --> 52:00.000
you know, this cynical,
you know, issue of voting access,

52:00.080 --> 52:03.080
knowing particularly this year elections

52:03.200 --> 52:07.280
that have started, primaries and caucus.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.080
So, Emily, thank you.

52:09.080 --> 52:12.320
for summing it up with the data
and new polling.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.560
And, you know,

52:14.560 --> 52:18.240
there are so many organizations
who are working on this issue right now.

52:18.480 --> 52:22.320
And, you know,
if it's a situation in which

52:22.400 --> 52:24.960
I feel like we will know more,

52:24.960 --> 52:29.400
we go along about the type of improvement,
what has been happening.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.920
But we also already are seeing, you know,

52:33.000 --> 52:37.720
the issue of voter suppression
discrimination, etc..

52:37.800 --> 52:41.880
And so time is running out to make
those changes is what I've been hearing

52:41.880 --> 52:43.320
from community members.

52:43.320 --> 52:45.080
So I'll keep it short and brief.

52:45.080 --> 52:53.400
And thank you,
Madam Chairman. Acting Chairman.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.920
AC GORODN: Thank you, Risa, and thank you all for sharing.

52:55.920 --> 53:00.600
I greatly appreciate the work
that you are doing in each of your own

53:00.680 --> 53:04.360
communities,
in your daily jobs and your work

53:04.440 --> 53:07.560
that tie back to your important role
here on this council.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.560
So thank you.

53:10.800 --> 53:11.920
Let me take a moment

53:11.920 --> 53:15.200
to briefly look at the agenda.

53:15.280 --> 53:18.520
Okay.

53:18.600 --> 53:21.680
Now we are moving into two presentations

53:21.680 --> 53:27.560
we have for today.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.200
The first presentation

53:29.200 --> 53:33.360
being from a representative
from the Census Bureau.

53:33.440 --> 53:37.480
But before we get into that,
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge

53:37.560 --> 53:46.240
and to thank

53:46.320 --> 53:48.360
Ana

53:48.360 --> 53:51.160
Torres-Davis,

53:51.160 --> 53:55.520
she is a senior attorney advisor with NCD,

53:55.600 --> 54:00.600
and we want to take a moment to recognize
her work on this specific issue.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.880
Her work has been tremendous.

54:02.880 --> 54:07.480
She has been in leadership
roles in research.

54:07.560 --> 54:10.880
She has brought stakeholders together
for further analysis of

54:10.880 --> 54:13.600
the Census Bureau's proposal,

54:13.680 --> 54:15.000
which is changing how they

54:15.000 --> 54:20.640
collect data on disability.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.680
Currently, the ACA

54:22.680 --> 54:26.160
American Communities Analytics

54:26.240 --> 54:29.960
has several people with disabilities

54:29.960 --> 54:33.760
currently tracked
by the American Community Survey.

54:33.840 --> 54:38.280
Currently, the Bureau estimates
that 14% of people in the U.S.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.720
have a disability.

54:39.720 --> 54:44.600
A change has been proposed
that will reduce this number

54:44.600 --> 54:47.600
by almost 40%.

54:47.720 --> 54:51.040
This is obviously a critical issue
in our community,

54:51.120 --> 54:53.760
in many of our organizations and here NCD,

54:53.760 --> 54:58.280
we have expressed our concerns
to the Census Bureau.

54:58.360 --> 55:04.000
We need to have a voice in this process.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.680
This has the potential

55:05.680 --> 55:09.560
to cause so much harm to the disability
community.

55:09.640 --> 55:15.640
A lower count will impact state programs,

55:15.720 --> 55:17.400
safety and security

55:17.400 --> 55:21.160
for people with disabilities and more.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.880
We have met with the Census Bureau

55:23.880 --> 55:24.440
head.

55:24.440 --> 55:28.920
We have also submitted comments
and we have asked them

55:28.920 --> 55:33.280
to pause this process,
to pause this change, and to take time

55:33.360 --> 55:41.520
to listen to the community
and take a more thoughtful approach.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.720
This week, as I mentioned earlier,

55:43.720 --> 55:48.120
the Census Bureau announced
that they are pausing this change.

55:48.120 --> 55:51.880
They will not deploy this change in 2025.

55:51.960 --> 55:54.720
We are grateful that today

55:54.720 --> 55:58.680
we have two representatives here
from the Census Bureau

55:58.680 --> 56:03.480
to tell us more about these changes
and about the introductions.

56:03.720 --> 56:06.720
We have with us today, Tasha Boone,

56:06.760 --> 56:09.240
who is the assistant director

56:09.240 --> 56:13.880
for the Decennial Census Program.

56:13.960 --> 56:17.720
We also have with us

56:17.800 --> 56:19.560
Julie

56:19.560 --> 56:23.360
Julie Weeks.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.160
Julie is the chief

56:25.160 --> 56:30.520
of the Measures Research and Evaluation
Branch Division of Analysis

56:30.600 --> 56:33.440
and Epidemiology at the National Center

56:33.440 --> 56:38.120
for Health Statistics.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.320
Welcome to each of you, Tasha.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.120
Thank you.

56:41.120 --> 56:48.320
Thank you,
both of you, for being with us here today.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.680
As we've shared earlier

56:49.680 --> 56:53.000
in the meeting,
we had had some accessibility issues.

56:53.080 --> 56:57.400
If anyone has any accessibility issues
during this presentation, please do

56:57.400 --> 56:58.200
let us know.

56:58.200 --> 57:01.480
Feel free to put your message in the chat
or send me a text message.

57:01.560 --> 57:07.240
Thank you, Tasha and Julie.

57:07.320 --> 57:10.040
TASHA BOONE: Thank you and good afternoon.

57:10.040 --> 57:14.480
I really appreciate being here
with you today.

57:14.560 --> 57:18.240
And so does Julie,

57:18.320 --> 57:20.600
who has joined us.

57:20.600 --> 57:24.040
With the Census Bureau
being from NCHS

57:24.120 --> 57:27.400
and we really appreciate the opportunity

57:27.480 --> 57:31.000
to continue the conversation with you all

57:31.080 --> 57:34.960
about this important topic.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.440
Donna cannot be here today.

57:37.440 --> 57:40.080
She was invited to speak at a second

57:40.080 --> 57:45.360
meeting with the White House,
Office of Public Engagement,

57:45.440 --> 57:49.160
about what we're doing around this topic.

57:49.240 --> 57:53.440
So we're having lots of conversations.

57:53.520 --> 57:55.120
So good news.

57:55.120 --> 57:59.920
Thank you for saying already
that we released the blog

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
on this Tuesday,

58:03.080 --> 58:06.720
and it was because we heard you

58:06.800 --> 58:10.560
lots of engagement, lots of discussion.

58:10.640 --> 58:11.760
Through.

58:11.760 --> 58:15.240
Questions, meetings,

58:15.320 --> 58:18.320
the FRN process

58:18.360 --> 58:22.400
where we heard a lot of public feedback.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.920
So in conjunction with

58:25.000 --> 58:26.240
the National Center

58:26.240 --> 58:29.240
for Health and Statistics

58:29.400 --> 58:31.080
and OMB,

58:31.080 --> 58:34.080
we decided obviously to not move

58:34.080 --> 58:38.080
forward with the disability questions for collection

58:38.080 --> 58:42.160
year 2025.

58:42.240 --> 58:44.760
But what we do want to do

58:44.760 --> 58:49.240
is continue to engage with all of you

58:49.320 --> 58:55.560
people from the national federal agencies
as well as individuals

58:55.800 --> 59:00.800
and communities representing
this community, so we can continue

59:00.880 --> 59:03.880
the conversation about addressing

59:03.880 --> 59:09.760
the needs and concerns for the community.

59:09.840 --> 59:12.840
So with that said,

59:12.880 --> 59:17.240
today, we would like to cover

59:17.320 --> 59:22.080
some important background and context

59:22.160 --> 59:29.280
and some next steps to move forward.

59:29.360 --> 59:33.040
So we'll cover a couple of items.

59:33.120 --> 59:35.880
One, the core for the Census

59:35.880 --> 59:41.680
Bureau's mission
is that through our survey and censuses,

59:41.760 --> 59:46.200
we captured critical information
for the nation

59:46.280 --> 59:51.280
to help decision
makers make the best decisions.

59:51.360 --> 59:54.360
And that means that we need to ensure

59:54.520 --> 59:59.840
our data
is of the highest possible quality.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.240
And there are many ways that we do that.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.120
The most critical

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.960
is making sure that we reach
as many people as possible

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.800
to ensure they are seen and heard

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.840
through our censuses and surveys.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.880
So there are three important values

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.880
to that that we hold dear

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.920
scientific integrity to ensure

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.240
we're using the best science

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.200
for the work that we're trying to achieve.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.040
Relevancy.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.040
Collect relevant data
based on the needs of the community.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.960
And that's what
we've been hearing a lot from you about

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.360
transparency, is ensuring

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.000
that we're sharing our process
with our stakeholders.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.720
And a big part of this is about
our governance process as well.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.200
The ACS is a mechanism
to help us to achieve this mission.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.040
In order

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.000
to get on the ACS, a federal agency

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:10.400
must demonstrate a statutory, regulatory,

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.000
or policy need.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.080
Since we posted the FRN,

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.000
we received over 12,000 comments.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.680
So many of you submitted

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.080
lots of good information to us

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.480
through this process.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.080
We have realized that the disability

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.600
community has many needs

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.600
and I just want to do quick check.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.640
We don't see the slides and I don't know

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.120
if they were pulled down,
but I just wanted to double check on that.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:46.800
LEWIS: Okay.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.800
Tasha,  I can pull them back up.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.120
I'm so sorry.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.800
Are you ready now?
BOONE: Yes.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.800
LEWIS: Okay. Will do. Thank you so much.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:03.040
BOONE: Thank you.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.080
And so just
so that people know where we are.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.600
Slide to the next slide.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.400
I think I was just about to cover
a few topics.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.440
Not perfect.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.120
We go back one.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.400
We will have.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.960
What we wanted to discuss with you today.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.720
Are concerns
raised about the proposed changes?

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.400
Why we are asking this question and

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.520
what this question covers.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.160
Where are we in the process

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.240
and next steps related to disability data.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.280
So you can stay right here on this slide

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.560
because I'm hoping that much of this
will address the concerns

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:56.040
that you mentioned in the letter
that you wrote to the Census Bureau.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.280
So why does the access include questions

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280
on functioning disability?

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.480
The access collects this information
to help enforce

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.280
and ensure that we have laws
and regulations and policies.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.320
The information provides a consistent approach

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:23.080
with international organizations
for the disability measurement

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.520
based on our content review in 2014,

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.760
there are 12 federal agencies

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:38.720
that have demonstrated a programmatic need
for this particular question.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.640
Next slide.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.440
So how do the changes get on the ACS?

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.080
As many of you know,

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.080
the American Community Survey

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.440
is a key data source

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.200
for numerous federal statistical agencies

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.040
and other executive branch agencies.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.400
And obviously,
many of you and your organizations

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.240
use a lot of this data as well.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.880
I talked about scientific integrity

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.680
and some of the things
that support that rigor are to ensure

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.040
we have the best science available,
such as changes

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.240
to the ACS that have to follow

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.120
a prescribed process and proposals

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.800
and must meet specific decision criteria.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.880
A federal agency, government agency

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.560
has to justify a need

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.800
for a new survey measurement
on a specific topic,

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.000
and there is no other sources
that could reasonably

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
meet that information.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.200
With that said,

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.880
I'll turn it over to Julie

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.240
to cover the next three slides
and then I'll come back

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.880
to just highlight our decision

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.440
and then cover some of the stakeholder
next steps that we have going on.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.560
And then we'll wrap up and have questions.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.280
Julie?
JULIE WEEKS: Thanks, Tasha.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.680
Next slide, please.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.160
Hello, everyone.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.920
One of the things that I want to do right off

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.080
the bat is kind of underscore

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.160
that for many of you,
you've heard this information.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.120
A lot of it is background
and has been provided

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.520
in different contexts
and different meetings.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.440
But if you haven't,
then I'd like to just start

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.120
by saying that one of things
that I want to highlight is the space

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.120
in which this work is being done
is that of officials statistics.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.200
So those that are collected
that must meet standards for definition

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.200
measurement and national, international
reporting purposes,

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.480
Those processes generally

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.240
and a substantial portion
of what is collected for official

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.080
statistical purposes is produced by the 13

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.320
agencies that have statistical work
as their principal mission.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.400
And the National Center for Health
Statistics is one of those.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.120
So on this slide, I simply want to mention

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.720
that what the justification

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.320
I'm seeing a caption

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:33.160
that says we need to pause is that

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:37.960
is that for me?

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.800
AC GORDON: Yes. We will take a quick moment.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.600
We are seeing that the caption here
has had a technical issue

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.840
with a bad cable and the questioner
needs 2 minutes to get back on line.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.200
So we'll take a quick pause
and my apologies.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.280
We will just take a quick part
of the caption time.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.080
All right.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.040
We will move forward
with our presentation.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.960
Again, thank you for your patience.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.440
And then we will open up a time, a brief
discussion for our council members.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.320
So Tasha and Julie

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.080
from the U.S.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.800
Census, thank you so much.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.560
Please continue your presentation.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.600
WEEKS: Okay.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.520
I'm going to wait
till the slides are up on the screen.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.520
Okay.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.120
So let me continue with

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.680
where we are in terms

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.640
of the justification for the proposal

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.480
to change the content,
the disability content

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:43.240
in the American Community Survey
and what was part of that proposal.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.080
So first and foremost,

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.240
the measurement of disability
had to be conceptualized in a manner

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:56.080
that was consistent with the international
and national standards.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:01.240
WHO's international classification
of functioning disability and health,

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:06.680
which is endorsed by UN and member
countries, but also here in the U.S.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.160
by the National Institutes of Health,
the Department of Health

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.720
and Human
Services, the Centers for Disease Control

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.240
all use a functional approach
to collect information

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.000
to assess disability. So

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.560
any new content had to consider

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.120
or to be in alignment conceptually

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.520
with those current models and measures.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.240
This was what was necessary

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.040
to meet a number of requirements.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.160
Now, tangentially, I understand that
may not be sufficient for other purposes

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.120
and for other data collections
that do not have these requirements.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:56.880
For example, the ACS can serve
as a platform for six questions.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.120
There are more than 40 questions
on the National Health Interview survey.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.360
For example.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:08.560
But for this purpose,
that was one of the requirements.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.040
NCHS has a programmatic mandate

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.360
to collect detailed information
on health, functioning and disability

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:22.680
and the National Health Survey Act of 1956
sets that requirement and authorizes

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.840
the NHIS, the National Health Interview

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.840
Survey to do that.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.360
So insofar as the proposal aligned

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.160
with that current content
that is also on the HIS,

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.960
that was an important
justification piece as well.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.920
Next, and to meet the

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.680
needs for more detailed information
on health

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.360
risks, behaviors,
care access and utilization

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.000
NCHS and our data users
need more detailed information

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.240
on functioning
than what a dichotomy can provide.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.560
So The information that is the severity

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.880
was far more important than just

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.880
the presence of a functional difficulty.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.560
So in the same way, for example,
that the experience of disability

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.360
is not a dichotomy,
nor can be the policies

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.840
and programs that are designed
to support people with disabilities.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.840
We need to collect information
that informs

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.080
the continuum of experiences.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.920
It was important that we consider

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.960
harmonization across data collections
in such a way

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.080
to ensure that the standards are used
for the collection of information.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.400
Part of that impetus

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.800
for the proposed change was to ensure
that the American Community Survey

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.160
is collecting functioning and disability
data in a manner that's consistent

01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.000
with other federal surveys
such as the Census Pulse,

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.760
the National Survey of Family Growth,
the National Health and Nutrition

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.520
Examination Survey,

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.200
not only
with those federal data collections,

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.520
but also all of the sponsored
data collections by USAID,

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.800
the World Bank and multiple U.N.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.240
agencies.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.200
So the revision would really bring us
into compliance

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.320
with the measurement requirements
set out by the international community,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.400
which has adopted those six questions

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.440
since 2006.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.200
The revision would ensure
that our obligations under the UN

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.160
standards
for censuses and population surveys

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.480
and for international reporting
requirements such as the Sustainable

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.480
Development Goals would be met.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.240
It's also important

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.800
because it provides the data needed,
for example, in the Department of Health

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.640
and Human Services,
where we make international comparisons

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.720
in the health People program.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.440
For example,
if you're familiar with that program,

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.880
we use that measure of disability

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.680
to track our ten year goals
for the nation's health and well-being.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.200
Next slide, please.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.400
So I don't want to spend

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.400
a whole bunch of time on this slide.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.840
However, given that in Tasha's portion,

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.600
she highlighted the fact that proposals
to change

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.680
the ACS content must also demonstrate
adequate development and testing.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.760
This was the information that was provided
as part of the proposal process.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.560
So prior to being endorsed by the U.N.,
the Washington Group

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.960
questions were both cognitively
and field tested

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.920
in multiple rounds and languages

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.680
and over a dozen two dozen countries.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.560
And to date, there are about 125

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.320
countries who use the six questions,

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.880
and many of those
are actually using the longer 37

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.800
question set,
which is called the extended set.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.080
And that extended set asks
additional domains

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:16.000
of functioning,
such as anxiety depression, upper body

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.760
functioning, pain and fatigue,
which are especially important

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.160
given the relationship of these symptoms
to the experience of chronic conditions.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:33.760
Next slide.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.160
For the next great.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.960
Again, many of you are aware
of the proposed change.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.000
So very succinctly,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.280
the change that was proposed in 2018

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.320
sets out three changes.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.520
It eliminates the word

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.960
serious, allowing respondents,
as I mentioned before,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.920
to report a greater variability
and functional difficulties.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.080
The revision also eliminates the words

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.000
Deaf and Blind,
as those terms are known to be sensitive

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.240
and not endorsed widely
or consistently across respondents.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.920
And finally, the proposed set would use
a graded response set to capture more

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.920
detailed information on severity,

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.800
allowing for combinations
of response patterns.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.160
It also adds a question
on a communication,

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.080
which is fairly important.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.280
Functional,
especially among the population

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.640
with intellectual
and developmental disabilities.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.000
So that's the proposal.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.600
The justifications meeting,

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.920
the criteria that is set out by the ICSP.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.120
I'm going to turn it back to Tasha.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.880
BOONE: Thank you, Julie.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.000
We'll go to the next slide.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.320
I appreciate you covering that background.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.760
It's very helpful
to understand how we arrived here.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.840
I'm going to take us through
just very quickly

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.720
the process, as we've already talked about

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.800
and that’s what this slide lays out for you,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.840
is that length of time and the governance

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.600
that's involved
to ensure that the question

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.600
that is proposed or questions

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.120
that are put on the ACS
do follow a rigorous process.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.960
Julie just alluded to some of that.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.200
We have proposals.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.880
We have the cognitive testing.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.880
We have field tasks that we do

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.480
in order to determine
how this question or questions work.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.720
And then we do the evaluation.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.600
Again, we're following this process
for every single question

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.200
and or questions
that are proposed for the ACS.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.840
We always go out to the public
to solicit feedback.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.520
Unprecedented in the history of the ACS

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.680
I think we got a lot of
feedback, as you well know,

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.880
from the

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.040
public and from organizations
such as yourself

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.920
to provide feedback on the questions
that we were proposing for disability.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.040
And so after, as you know,

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.360
careful evaluation on our decision point
at this point in

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.400
time is not to move forward
with the proposed questions.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.080
Even though Julie laid out
the justifications of why?

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.640
Because we do recognize
that it's a broader

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.240
understanding that needs to be had about

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.560
the full landscape of the needs.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.480
So when I go to the next slide
and talk a little bit

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.360
about what some of those 12,000 comments

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.400
kind of encapsulated.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.280
There is a need for more

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.000
comprehensive public engagement
that was identified

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.760
and we're doing that,. Part of
that is what we're doing today

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.320
and will continue to
to do. In the next slide, which I think

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.320
is the next two slides
that my final slides

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.080
I'll talk very quickly
about what we plan on doing.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:21.360
if you don't mind going back to the next
slide--the previous slide, sorry.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.160
And the other concerns that

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:27.040
were laid out
is that existing and proposed questions

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.920
do not include more or all types
of disabilities.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.440
Concern regarding break in series

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.960
A gap in the data
availability and comparisons

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:45.240
across  measures. Request for more estimates that reflect

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.920
the WG-SS graded

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.600
response categories,
including no difficulty,

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:57.400
some difficulty,
a lot of difficulty and cannot do at all.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.480
There is also request
for a different cutoff

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.720
concerned that the proposed
use of the international standard cutoff

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:10.000
for disability, which does not include
people reporting some difficulty,

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.240
would decrease the estimate of people
living with disabilities.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.720
And there is also a concern
that the proposed change in data

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.400
would impact program funding and services.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.040
So the next slide,

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.600
what have we been doing
since we heard all of this feedback?

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.000
We have analyzed the feedback.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.000
Obviously,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.080
we had several engagements
and some of them

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.680
went back to September year

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.120
where we first
presented at our scientific sense

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.320
the scientific advisory Committee, where
this public about the proposed changes.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.880
Then in November
we met with our National advisory

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.640
committee, also public and talked about it there.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.560
We received feedback from both of those.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.960
Then December 6, we had a briefing with

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.720
many different organizations
that was hosted by the Leadership

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.560
Conference Coalition
and got a lot of feedback there.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.640
And then December 8th

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.800
our director met

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.120
with a few organizations,
including your own.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.440
December 14th,

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.160
we did a presentation with the White House

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.840
and talked about aging

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.920
and disability
with the aging and disability community.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.560
And then January 19th.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.120
Census and NCHS

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.920
The staff on the Senate Subcommittee
on Health, Education,

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.480
Labor and Pensions
and the Subcommittee on Aging.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.440
And they talked a lot of also about the

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.520
proposed changes and their needs.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.520
And then February 8th today, obviously

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.160
a meeting with you
and I mentioned that Donna Daley

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.000
is the division chief
of the American Community Survey,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
was meeting with the White House
at the same time.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.160
And, of course,
we received lots of letters

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.400
in addition to what was submitted
through the FRN process.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.800
And then we're continuing and have been
meeting with other federal agencies.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.040
And then, of course the ICSP.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.680
Next slide.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.280
So where we are today? Obviously

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.720
we received comments, the 12,000 comments

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.400
from over 150 organizations,

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.280
20 local and state governmental groups,

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.160
over 300 people
with university affiliation.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.680
Of course, thousands of people
with disabilities also wrote in

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.440
and gave comments, and we received
comments from federal agencies.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.520
Some are part of the Disability
Interagency Subcommittee

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.840
and some
that were not part of this committee.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.280
So where are we?

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.760
One, the things that I said
at the top of the presentation

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.720
is that we heard you
and that we fully recognize

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.160
through all of this feedback
that there's a need to really understand

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.880
all the uses and purposes
for this particular data.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.600
What are people
trying to do with this data?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.000
What is the that they need to
in order to achieve those needs?

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.800
And we recognize that the asks questions
are not the for answer to that.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.560
So we want to understand
the full landscape of that

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:38.200
and be able to come together with you
and other organizations like yourselves

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.920
in order to talk with the federal agencies
and have a conversation

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
so that we're understanding
and hearing from each other

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.440
so we can do the evaluation and understand

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.080
do we currently have data
to meet those needs?

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:57.400
And if we don't,
then maybe we need to create some products

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.080
or new questions on surveys or censuses
in order to capture those needs

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.640
so that we can better measure
the needs for the disability community.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.640
So that's what we plan to do in
the spring,

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.560
is have this meeting. On our last slide.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.200
The next slide.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.080
It just talks

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.920
about our continued engagement
that we're having.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.880
This meeting won't be the last that we'll
have with many different organizations.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.080
We're interested
in continuing the conversation.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160
You know, we just published the blog.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.480
We're continuing our stakeholder meetings.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.920
And this spring coming up soon,
we plan to announce

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.920
when we plan to have that meeting
and look forward to

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.240
having your participation in that meeting
so that we can work together.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.040
And then, of course,
we will finally publish

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.640
our 30 day FRN

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:58.120
for this content
for the proposed content for the 2025.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.920
It will not include

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.480
the proposed questions to disability,
but we do have other content

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.960
that we're moving forward
with other proposed changes.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.560
And then of course, in May,
we release the final decisions on that

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:18.840
so that we can then move forward
with implementing the 2025

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:25.000
content changes, which again
will not include this proposed question.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.720
So with that,

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.320
I think we have some time for questions
and we really want to hear from you.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.560
So thank you very much.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.400
Julia and I are very pleased
to have been able to have the opportunity

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.680
to present to you.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.840
And we look forward to further engagement.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.280
We're open for questions
and turn it back over to the moderator.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.760
CM BRADDY: Madam Chair, I have a question.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:55.840
If you allow me.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.400
AC GORDON: Of course.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.120
First of all, I just want to say thank you both

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.520
for your wonderful comprehensive presentation

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:07.880
And I wanted to thank you
for your partnership and also ask

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.960
my fellow council members to pass on our
thanks to

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.400
Census Director,

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.200
Robert Santos as well.

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.960
Please do pass on our gratitude to him.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.240
We are so thankful that you have heard
us and heard our community.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.680
So I will turn it over.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.000
I know we only have a few minutes left,
but we will open it up for any questions

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.440
for my fellow council members
with questions.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.040
Please go ahead.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.480
CM BRADDY: Yes. Again,
thank you for that information.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.480
And I got to ask this question.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.920
I didn't want to, but I got to ask.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.160
I do it a lot with my staff right.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.680
One of the things that we try to do
is when we make a mistake,

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:57.920
we pause and evaluate it
so we don't make that same mistake again.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.320
And so I'm wondering, you know, what
have you learned from making this mistake?

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.360
And maybe you can't answer that,

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.200
but it is important that
that we learn from the things that we do.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:16.120
And I'm wondering
if you could talk about that for a second.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200
BOONE: Most certainly.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.360
And I thank you for your question.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.800
I think the way that we like
to look at this, like you said,

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.680
that there are lessons
learned as you go through your process.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:31.080
And one of the lessons that we learned
is that we need to make sure

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:34.400
that we have fuller engagement,

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.560
broad and wide, with representatives
from the stakeholder communities

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:45.920
and organizations that have a stake
in this in these types of questions.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.320
And so we are looking at our work
and our process

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.720
of how we continue to

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.080
get questions on the ACS.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.440
And we're looking at that holistic process
and seeing where do we need to ensure

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.240
that we're incorporating the

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.200
more stakeholder engagement.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:13.760
And so we are definitely saw
that as a need

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.680
and we are actively with our ICSP committee

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.280
to ensure that we have more robust
stakeholder engagement.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.040
So thank you.
CM BRADDY: Awesome. Thank you.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.640
Just need to hear that.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.320
WEEKS: May, I add something, if that's okay.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.560
In addition to the question
that was asked from Theo,

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.160
AC GORDON: Please do. Thank you, Julie.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.400
WEEKS: Okay Of course, I think this is

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.520
rather important.

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.320
There were lots of lessons learned.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.040
And I will I will mention one that
we have not been able to get to

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.440
in a lot of these conversations,
and I think it's very important

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.640
right now
we're we're trying to to set the stage.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.760
And like I said, I apologized at the
beginning because many of you have heard

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.080
some of what we just presented and we're
trying to get everyone at the same place.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.600
And that's really important.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.400
But one of the lessons learned is

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.120
and some us needed to hear this
more than others.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:22.800
I mean, we certainly know there there are
many needs for data on disability.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.120
And I think
one of the most important point,

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.560
you know, points for this
this coming year that

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.240
that will be important
is is hearing those needs

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.760
and I would

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.600
I would invite the community to come with

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.680
how do you use the data

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.480
please

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.160
What are the give us
examples of where the data kind of draws

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.920
a very specific line to resources
so that we ourselves

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.600
can use those examples
and leverage that knowledge

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.520
in our own work here.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.320
And I would say
if there are needs for data

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.680
that aren't collected through the ACS,

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.440
let's see if they are collected
elsewhere in these very large

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.600
nationally representative surveys
that have a lot more space.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.280
And those three topics to me
are some of the more robust

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.160
and fruitful conversations
that I'd very much like to get

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.720
during these engagements.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.720
So I, I really

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.600
appreciate and invite

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:45.040
much more conversation,
especially in those areas.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:45.600
Thank you

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.600
for letting
me make that additional intervention.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.680
AC GORDON: Yes, absolutely.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.880
Thank you very much, Julie,
for that important contribution.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.720
Before we let you go,
I was just wondering if you would be able

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.400
to share the slide deck
that was presented from today with Ana.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.800
at NCD for the record?

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.400
BOONE: Yes, I think we did send
and we'll just confirm that.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.280
So that all the participant participants
can have it.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.000
Absolutely. And again,
thank you very much.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.120
And we do look forward to engaging
with you further, particularly

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.640
at our upcoming spring meeting.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.680
AC GORDON: Yes, wonderful.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.440
If nothing more from my fellow
Council members.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:37.520
Then again, I can't say it enough times.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.600
Thank you so much.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.720
Thank you, all of you,
for a specifically Julie and Tasha

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:49.800
for your important work and us here at NCD
and the many disability organizations

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.760
and 22,000 commenters
will be here alongside

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.120
with you on this journey, making sure
that we get this right together.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.240
Thank you for listening to us,
for hearing our voice,

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.400
and for hearing the voice of the community
members that have joined today.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.560
To those community members,
I hope that you feel at ease

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.680
and know your contributions
are valuable in this process

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:19.000
and that the time you took to contribute
your voice had power

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.560
and has power at the individual
and collective voice.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.080
And you should be proud

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.040
and applaud yourselves and applaud
your public servants

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.000
for doing the right things
and for advocating for our communities.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.760
Thank you so much.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.880
Julian, Tasha, you're welcome to stay
and we

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.160
appreciate your additional time today,
but I think you have to go.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:47.920
So thank you.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Okay.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:54.080
We already took our break,
so I think we can continue

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:58.480
into our next presentation

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.040
for today's meeting.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.880
I just want to confirm
that our presenters are here

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.360
and that this is a good time
for us to start.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.880
We will have today

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:18.960
tied to an open project on transportation.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:19.600
My colleague

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.000
Emily will take the lead on this
and the next part of the agenda.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
So I am very happy to turn it over to you.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Emily.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.360
CM VOORDE: Thank you very much.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:37.600
Vice-Chair Claudia and to our colleagues
from the Census Bureau.

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.920
My name is Emily.

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:43.040
I'm a white woman with just past shoulder
length blond hair.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:46.920
And I am going to be introducing
our next panel today,

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.080
one that I am very personally
and professionally excited about.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.520
One of NCD’s policy priorities for 2024

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.760
is the development of  reports that examine
persistent barriers to full inclusion

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.880
in independence of people with mobility
disabilities, including the current state

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:10.000
of ground transportation, airline
travel and public rights of way.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:10.840
Three decades

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:14.800
after the ADA was passed, people
with mobility disabilities like myself

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.920
and many others on the call remain
extremely disadvantaged

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
by the current state
of ground transportation options

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.840
as the most common
forms of on demand transportation,

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.280
taxicabs and ride sharing platforms
like Uber and Lyft

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.120
are largely unavailable due to a lack
of wheelchair accessible vans.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:36.120
Air travel has been plagued

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.360
by frequent damage to wheelchairs
and injuries to people with disabilities.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.560
when on boarding and off
boarding flights. Communities

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:47.200
across the nation continue to inaccessible
sidewalks,

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:51.040
street crossings and bus stops
which prevent wheelchair users

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.560
and those with other mobility impairment
from moving safely.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.680
through our community

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.880
help inform our report.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:03.480
Today, we are honored representatives
from the US Access Board, the U.S.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.000
Department of Transportation,
and the US Department of Justice

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.680
join us to talk about public
right of way ground

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.680
transportation and airline
travel for people with disabilities.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.640
After the last presentation, there
will be a Q&A with our Council members.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:23.200
I will ask that our panelist
be mindful of time

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.200
and know that we will try to get to
as many questions as possible.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.120
We will start our public comment period

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.720
slightly after the 4:00 Eastern hour.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.800
I want to just briefly introduce
our panelists.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:41.200
Our first panlelsit is Juliet Shoultz,
a transportation systems engineer

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.280
and accessibility
specialist at the US Access Board.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.680
Welcome, Juliet.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.640
We have seen a class action lawsuit
against New York, Philadelphia

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.440
and recently in Baltimore because of impassable sidewalks,

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.200
lack of curb cuts and in general
inaccessibility of public spaces.

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.560
We're very interested in the Access
Board's recently released rule on public

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.240
right of way and how it will remedy
this persistent issue.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.200
So, Juliet, thank you so much
for being with us here again today.

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.440
You have the floor.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.760
JULIET SHOULTZ:  Thanks for having me.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:20.320
Yes, so the Access Board finalized the public right of way  accessibility guidelines

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.320
last year in August and,

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.240
what we did is we--
the proposed rule was published in 2013.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.200
And so over that time, ten years,

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.480
we've had a lot of input from the public.

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.960
We've had we've addressed

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:40.840
technical assistance questions
from designers and advocates.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.480
And so we took all that information

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:48.600
and that in part informed
what the final product looks like.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:52.720
So I'll highlight a few of the changes

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.320
that if you're familiar with the rule,
it's a big rule.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.920
And what we've done is we do have
trainings on our YouTube channel

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.560
to kind of help people get acclimated
with it and those familiar with it.

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:07.000
There is a what's new

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.960
video that kind of highlights the changes,

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.320
but some of the things we did
is we removed the MUTCD language.

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:18.160
MUTCD is a transportation manual,
and we used to reference it

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.760
for, for example,
accessible pedestrian signals.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.840
And so for ease of use and just to remove

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.960
any ambiguity about what's required
and what's optional,

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.360
we moved all of that language
into the PROWAG text itself.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.120
So now you have this one document

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.520
that tells you everything
you need to do for accessible design.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.720
We removed our advisory language
that we had in PROWAG.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.840
We no longer include advisories.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.280
The advisories are helpful,
but they're best suited for a guide

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.880
for guidance, material
and how to do things

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.040
because there was some confusion about

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.520
the advisories, mandates
or are they is it just

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.440
technical assistance?

01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.000
There are some advisories that we've
included in the final rule text

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000
as now a requirement, so our example at driveways that are yield

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.720
or stop controlled, we now require detectable warning services

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.480
and before that was just a discussion and advisory on what

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:15.800
to do at driveways with a yield or stop.

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.720
We have clarified the distinction
between new construction and alterations.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.640
That was always a source of confusion.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.120
And the reason
it's important to distinguish

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.640
the two is in new construction.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:32.800
The expectation is your facilities is
quite accessible, almost fully compliant.

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:38.360
Then fully compliant,
whereas in alterations,

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.080
which is a lot of the work that's  done out there by DoTs,
these already have

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.760
infrastructure, buildings,
utilities, roadways, whatnot.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:48.360
And so there's
some existing physical constraints.

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.560
So we wrote the text to kind of address
those concerns.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.840
But still, even with the existing
physical constraints,

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.240
expectation
is that the facilities when altered,

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.920
are accessible
to the maximum extent feasible.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.560
We did revise language
so that we're consistent with ADAG.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.640
ADAG has been around
much longer as a standard.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.680
And so we did things like for example,

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.400
the cross slope in ADAG
is 1 in 48 maximum.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:21.000
And so we did the same thing in PROWAG,
and stayed consistent with ADAG.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.720
at languages such as changes in local
versus vertical surface

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.440
discontinuities that we were referring to.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.400
So you'll see those changes really about consistency.

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.880
Another change we made was,

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:37.240
I talked about the detectable warning surfaces at driveways.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.760
We expanded the treatment options
for roundabouts.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.640
So in the proposed rule,
there was only one option for roundabouts.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.080
But in talking to transportation
engineers and others in industry,

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.720
we found that there was a need to expand
the treatment options

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:59.200
and hopefully further research will refine
if there is indeed some options

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:03.280
that are a lot more accessible
than others.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.680
We added visual contrast

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.600
requirements for stairs,
and that is a new requirement.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.280
There was an overwhelming request
for us to make that a requirement.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.880
So at top of the stairs, tread or landing,

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.200
there needs to be a visual contrast
as best just really

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.680
a high level of what we've added,
what's in the new rule.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.120
so the Access Board, we finalized the  guidelines

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.000
and when we finalize a set of guidelines,
there is a mandate

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.480
for the enforcing agencies
to adopt them as standards.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.520
They can increase the accessibility,

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.360
but they cannot adopt something
that's less than what we've required.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.920
And so that would be the next step.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.080
We don't do it enforcing
other than at ABA facilities.

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.920
So in order for PROWAG to be enforceable under the ADA,

01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:00.160
it would need to be adopted by Department,
Justice Department, Transportation

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.200
and ABA.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:01.800
The architecture

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:05.640
barriers, various federal facilities,
for example, at military base,

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.320
they would need to be adopted
by Department of Defense, U.S.

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:13.360
Postal Service and all the other ABA agencies.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.600
So that's really a very high level
of what's changed and what's next.

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.920
We continue to

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.760
field technical assistance
questions on the final rule.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.400
We provide trainings. We're very busy
with doing trainings.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.520
And like I mentioned earlier, we have the
YouTube trainings that we've provided

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.680
and hoping people will look at this
as an updated resource

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:40.600
and making sure there's accessible
design of the public right of way.

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:46.080
And I'll take questions.

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.280
CM VOORDE: Thank you so much, Juliet.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.480
We're I believe we're actually going
to hold questions until the end

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:55.720
after all three of our distinguished
guests have spoken.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.800
So if we can just pause there

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.680
and I want to introduce our second
speaker,

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.280
a good friend and a mentor,

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.480
Kelly Buckland, the disability policy
advisor in the Secretary's office

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.560
at the US Department of Transportation.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.160
Prior to this role, was the executive director

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.560
of NICL, the National Council
on Independent Living.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.160
Welcome, Kelly.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.160
You're familiar
with all three of these issues

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.120
from your former at NICL
and in your current role.

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.040
We know that DOT has been very active

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.160
in this administration on air travel
issues faced by people with disabilities.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.360
And we're interested in hearing
about DOT initiatives on these topics.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:42.520
We'd also like to hear from you on your thoughts regarding ground

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:48.320
transportation challenges with taxis and
rideshares such as Uber and Lyft.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.760
So with that, I'll turn it over to you.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.040
Really good to see you.
Thanks for being with us today.

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.200
KELLY BUCKLAND: Yeah, well, thanks, Emily.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.800
It's really good to see you, too.

01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.280
And a number of my other friends. Hi Neil.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.960
I could go on.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.560
but I’ll stop there.

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.800
My presentation was the PowerPoint.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.600
So what I would just request
is that maybe the PowerPoint

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:17.120
could be sent out to people afterwards
so they'll have it.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.040
But I was appointed to this position

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.560
by the president in September

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.880
of 21.

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.920
So after being appointed,
I started working on a set of disability

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.760
policy priorities, and those were

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.760
then adopted by

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.040
the Secretary and the Department

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:48.320
on July 26th of 2022, which Emily

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.320
you attended the ADA celebration
that we did

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:56.800
back then and heard
about the policy priorities at that point.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:59.520
So what we did and these

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.760
are on the DOTwebsite of

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.520
which is at

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.560
dot.gov/accessibility, but

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.120
what the department did was adopted
a basically four pillars

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.120
and there's different goals
under each of the pillars.

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.280
But the first one is enabling safe
and accessible air travel,

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:22.840
which for people with disabilities
right now

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.720
everyone knows that's
neither safe nor accessible.

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.720
So the second pillar was enabling

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.720
multi-modal accessibility of public rights of way.

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.720
The third was to enable access to good

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.360
paying jobs or business opportunities
for people with disabilities.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:45.240
And the fourth was to enable accessibility
of electric vehicles,

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.040
charging and automated vehicles.

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:52.240
So we then had some overarching things

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:56.000
we also wanted to do,
which one was to reinvigorate

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.960
programmatic enforcement of the Air
Carrier Access Act,

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:05.320
the Americans with Disabilities Act,
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:09.120
Section 508 and Section 503.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.200
We also wanted to advance

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:16.000
diversity, equality, inclusion,
and accessibility of the DOT.

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.760
workforce.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.760
We wanted to address gaps in data,

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.480
on people with disabilities in transportation.

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:27.280
There is a huge lack of data
in transportation

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.920
on people with disabilities specifically.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.520
And then we also wanted to make sure
that all DOT

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.600
meetings were fully accessible to people with disabilities.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:43.040
and I'll give you
a little bit of an update

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:46.640
on each of these.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.800
So I'm going to start with

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.160
enabling safe and accessible air travel,

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:55.200
and I'll probably try to end
this similarly with

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.320
with a little bit of information
about taxi cabs.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.920
So of

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.800
the goals underneath

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.760
enabling safe and accessible
air travel were the following.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:10.920
We wanted to develop

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.320
an advanced research roadmap

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:17.120
building off of the Access Board

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.400
and the Transportation Research Board's

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.920
report on the feasibility of

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.640
wheelchair
security systems on passenger aircraft,

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.760
which will support

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.920
future rulemaking by the department,
which would then make it a rule

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:38.840
that wheelchair spot
be provided on airplanes.

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:39.840
So the next thing

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.840
was to ensure rulemaking, to ensure

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:46.400
safe accommodations for air travelers
with disabilities using a wheelchair.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.000
So we have an NPRM
that will be coming out

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.800
in the next few weeks

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.360
that will address

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.720
both the mishandling of wheelchairs

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.800
and the

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.840
unsafe handling of people with
disabilities, which results in injuries.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.520
So the rule is going to make it a pro se

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.520
violation

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.680
of the Air Carriers

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.640
Access Act
if a wheelchair is damaged by an airline.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.440
Right now, the wording is a little fuzzy.

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.400
So the airlines can deny that they violated the Act.

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:29.440
This will make it a pro se violation

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.600
And so

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:33.840
at that point,

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.840
they'll just automatically be found guilty
of violating the Air Carrier Access Act

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:41.600
and then will be subject to fines.

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.440
We also

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.240
we're going to issue a NPRM
and final rule

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.000
on accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.080
We did that this last July.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:57.720
We did issue a final rule
on accessible accessible lavatories.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.560
There's a number of things
that are going to be required in the next

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:04.920
three years,
which one is to make the interior of the

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.560
of the bathrooms on single aisle
aircraft more accessible.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.440
by providing some of the features that have to now be  accessible,

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.200
like are grab bars,

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.840
accessible water faucets, that kind of stuff.

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.560
The on board wheelchair will also need to be made --

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.680
there will be a number of different things

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.920
that will have to be done to that
to make it more accessible.

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:32.680
And airlines will not be able to just

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:36.080
defer until there's a fully accessible model.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.280
They have to purchase the on board wheelchair

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.520
that's most accessible.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.560
that's on the market until one more accessible becomes available.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.840
We're also expanding
enforcement activities related to the Air

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.680
Carrier Access Act
and its implementing regulations.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.280
You will know that

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.200
lot of people have been really frustrated.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.440
They filed a complaint
with the Department of Transportation.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.600
It sort of goes to the big black hole.

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.840
Nothing ever happens with it.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.960
Nobody ever gets an answer back.

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:10.960
So we're trying to win back
the trust of the public

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:13.760
that when they file a complaint
with a department,

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.760
they know that something's going to happen
and that their complaint will

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.160
be processed.

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.760
So the department has hired
on eight new attorneys

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:25.520
for the air carrier or for the FAA,

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.680
consumer protection division,

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:33.040
as well as hiring on some more analysts
that will process the complaints.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:37.720
We anticipate
getting rid of the backlog of complaints

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:40.720
by within the next year.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.280
And so when somebody files a complaint,
it will just be the process of

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:50.160
investigating the complaint that will be taking time.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.160
There will be no more backlog.

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.560
We've also actually brought over some detailees

01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:01.600
to also help
with the process of the complaints.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.800
And we want to educate people
with disabilities about their rights

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:09.200
under the Air Carrier Access Act and how to exercise that.

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.560
So We did release the

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:18.840
the airline Passengers
with Disabilities Bill of Rights.

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:25.080
That was done in July of 2023 as well.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:28.360
So that or maybe it was a little bit
before that,

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:32.560
and we have kicked off
a public awareness campaign

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.920
that is being done with both disability
advocacy organizations,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.160
instance, PVA,

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.840
Paralyzed Veterans of America
and the Airlines themselves.

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.240
So there's the Bill of Rights
is supposed to be published

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.240
in number of different places
where it's very visible and

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.320
allow people to get more information
about what

01:48:55.320 --> 01:49:02.200
their rights are.

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.320
So on the research

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:09.320
roadmap, I also want to give you a

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.200
small update here.

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.200
So the FAA did

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.720
issue like a three year

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:20.760
research road map to answer the questions

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.440
that were in the Transportation
Research Board's report.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.760
So they completed their first year

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.440
that was looking at wheelchairs
so that crash tested wheelchairs

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.000
and looked at wheelchairs, functionality
and that kind of stuff.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.640
So they've pretty much come to the determination that the WC19

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:45.840
wheelchairs will fulfill the requirements

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.120
of a chair to be allowed onto airplanes.

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.120
And the crash testing that's done

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:56.800
to determine that they're WC19 chair

01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.400
will be sufficient.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.960
And as some of you may know,

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.720
WC19 chairs most people are sitting in one.

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:09.640
Like for instance my chair is WC19 compliant.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.440
I don't have the travel add ons
like the handles

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:19.520
that are the places where you put the tie
down stuff but it's still WC 19

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.280
compliant wheelchair so that looks like
that will work this year.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.680
They're going to be

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.520
spending time on researching
the tie down systems in airplanes,

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.920
not trying to figure out what we need,
whether it's a four-strap

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.680
restraint system, kind of like

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.320
buses use or vans use or taxes use,

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.240
or whether we can use an in-floor
kind of restraint.

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.520
like a key restraint.

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.080
So the third and final year

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.960
will be researching the restraint systems
that keep people in their chairs.

01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:55.960
But anyway, so

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.120
we're we're at least halfway done
with The three year

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:03.120
roadmap of Delta Flight products

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.480
has also submitted a folding seat

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.840
to the FAA for certification.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:14.520
So the seat folds up that you can then
back your wheelchair into that same spot.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.480
And it has
it has tie down straps in that spot.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:22.480
And so

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.200
the industry is also working on this.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:28.200
Just want people know it's
not just DOT, but it's also industry

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:32.200
And HHS is doing some stuff as well around wheelchair

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:37.240
crash testing.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:42.400
Switching slides.  Sorry.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.480
So enabling safe and accessible air travel.

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.160
And another thing

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:50.440
I already mentioned the final rule on accessible lavatories,

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.920
so I won't go there again.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:02.360
The Office of
Consumer Protection with the

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.440
FAA also released

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.080
travel tips for wheelchair users on its website

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:13.880
in order to further educate passengers with disabilities about the benefits of

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:18.760
sharing information in advance with the airlines about their  wheelchairs and scooters.

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:23.400
And we don't know if people know,
but we did reach an agreement with United

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:26.800
and United has in the agreement

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.600
this was to to

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.520
on the Figueroa complaint where

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:35.760
some of you may remember, her chair was destroyed,

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.480
she then got pressure sores ended up dying
from those pressure sores.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.640
And so the complaint was filed
with the department.

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:48.480
So how the complaint was resolved

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:52.440
was to ask United to do a number of things.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.400
So one of the things they're going to do
is on their websites,

01:52:55.400 --> 01:53:00.480
they will be publishing the size of the cargo door,

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:04.840
so that you can tell whether or not
the dimensions will work for your chair.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:08.160
Instead of showing up at the airport
and finding out your chair won’t fit on an

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.160
airplane. So

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:12.160
there's a number of other things
that United

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.600
is going to be doing as a result of the

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.640
agreement, too.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:21.080
But they've also done
some stuff on their own, like they've

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:25.280
sort of provided Braille on everything and

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:28.320
also started providing

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:32.320
accessible in-flight communication

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:36.720
information with captioning
and even their entertainment’s captioned.

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:40.200
So, United is just kind of stepping it up

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:45.080
in some areas as well.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.640
So I won't go through the ten

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:52.080
the Passenger's Bill of Rights,
but there are ten of them.

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.160
And when you get the slides
you might want to look at those,

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.520
make sure you're educated about them.

01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:00.200
So when you fly you'll be able to

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.840
know what your rights are.

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.280
And I can answer questions later
about the rest of the stuff.

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.200
But then also
I want to move to the second priority,

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:13.280
which was enabling multi-modal
accessibility of public transportation

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.080
facilities, vehicles and right to work.

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.080
So we worked extensively
with the Access Board.

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:22.920
And when I say extensively, I mean that.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.880
And after ten years we finally got PROWAG

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.680
adopted by the Access Board
and now it's up to DOT

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:37.160
to adopt PROWAG so that it can be
enforced by DOT.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.960
So we've started the process of an NPRM,

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:43.480
that should actually be released
in just the next few weeks,

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.160
and we intend to complete that process

01:54:48.160 --> 01:55:00.520
and get a final rule out
before the end of this term.

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.160
We also

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.160
with Federal Highway

01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.800
sent out, I think, to all of the states

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.520
requiring them to send us their ADA
transition plans.

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.120
They're now up on a dashboard on the U.S.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.600
DOT website.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.520
You can look up at your state and you can
see what their ADA transition plan is.

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.360
It is
and what they've been able to complete.

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:27.120
We're also asking them to put up on there

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.800
how they're going to use their bipartisan
infrastructure law funds to address

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.720
the accessibility barriers
that are still there.

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:39.360
We will be issuing

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.160
a notice of proposed
rulemaking and a final rule

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:49.120
on equitable access to transit facilities
and updating the minimum guidelines.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.920
And we've also released over

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.240
$1 Billion under the Old Stations
Accessibility Program.

01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.120
We released $700 million

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.560
last December,
not December of 23, but December of 22.

01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.240
And this past December now

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:12.040
announced another $300 million.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:17.840
So there's over a billion dollars out there to address inaccessible legacy

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.400
railway stations and subway stations.

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:23.400
So about 15 cities got money,

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.120
but the bulk of that
is going to both Chicago and New York

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:32.080
because they have the most inaccessible
legacy stations still there.

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.600
We're also working really closely with and
have been since I got here with Amtrak,

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:44.560
and they have brought into compliance
a number of Amtrak stations

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.200
and are working on at least 11 more
or at least 11

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.120
more this year
and are working on a number for next year.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.240
I have to say I had some pretty

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.840
negative

01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:02.400
opinions of Amtrak
and those have all been changed.

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.920
I mean, they really have stepped up.

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.040
And I'm actually really proud of
a lot of the work that Amtrak is doing.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:13.040
They've made a complete culture change
and they've really become

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:17.120
really committed to making this,
making their services accessible.

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.960
We've also been working with them on
the design of new rail states for new rail

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.600
cars, for both the regional trains
and the long haul trains.

01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.080
Those are all going to be replaced
and the new cars are going to be

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.160
incredibly more accessible
than the ones that we currently have.

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.240
As a matter of fact,
you'll be able to go from car to car

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.240
and on the long haul trains
you'll be able to go to the observation

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.000
car and the dining car

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.320
by going from one car to another,
and there'll be elevators

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:51.280
will take you up to the second
level of the long haul cars.

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:55.840
So the whole rail situation is going to change a lot.

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:59.360
The only unfortunate part here is that it
takes a while to build trains,

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:06.120
so that you won't see them on the tracks
for another 5 to 10 years.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.520
You could see some more about

01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:11.680
that in my slides, but

01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:16.360
I want to move on to

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.040
enabling good

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:20.320
paying jobs and business opportunities.

01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.800
We incorporated language

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:25.800
on encouraging hiring of people disabilities

01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:28.880
in all of our grant
notices of funding opportunities

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:32.760
and our explanatory materials

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:37.440
and require them to comply with the ADA,

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:41.040
comply with Section 504, 508

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:45.160
and 503, meaning that

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.240
they're all federal contractors
and their subcontractors

01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.280
will have to try to meet
that 7% aspiration goal

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.000
within DOL's

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.200
rules.

01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:02.160
And we incorporated standard language
on encouraging the hiring

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:06.040
of people with disabilities in all of our DoT contracts.

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.080
And we're coordinating
with other federal agencies on regulatory

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:16.360
policy actions to expand the broadband
because we are also

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:20.840
affected by the Inflation Reduction Act,
and get some of those funding.

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:26.840
So we're going to be working on
increasing broadband access as well.

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:30.440
And the last one
and like I say, there's more information,

01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:35.320
but you'll see it when you get the slides that I'm sending.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.520
But on the last one

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:42.320
is to adopt or enable accessibility of

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.840
electric vehicle
charging and automated vehicles.

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.720
We worked with the Access Board
to develop, in fact at my request,

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:54.640
they really took up the mantle
and developed the set of accessibility guidelines

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:58.000
for, electric charging stations.

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:02.080
As you probably know,
the bipartisan infrastructure law

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.600
provides funding for a half

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:07.600
a million charging stations
across the country.

02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:12.040
So we're going to be building over 500,000

02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:13.080
charging stations.

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:16.080
We also just released funding

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:21.400
to repair charging stations
that are no longer functional.

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:26.560
And if somebody receives funding to repair
an existing charging station,

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:29.760
they then have to bring it
into all of the department's

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.960
compliance requirements,
including the accessibility requirement.

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:40.080
So even those charging stations will now
be retrofitted so that they're accessible.

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:45.280
What we did is started enforcing
the Access Boards guidelines

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:51.360
that they put out,
and now we've been working with them to

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.640
get the NPRM out so that we can start

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:59.040
making the accessibility requirements
in electric fueling stations.

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:02.160
A like a mandatory thing

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:05.160
under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.040
I just have one final thing, and that is

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:12.000
the department does have an

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.480
equity plan required by the White House

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:21.200
and not only is disability
prominent in the equity plan,

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.200
but it's really clear that disability

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.920
equity is a priority for the department.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.120
And I really just want to end by saying that

02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:37.120
this is my first time
ever being a federal employee.

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:40.560
And to be honest,
I had real trepidations about

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.560
whether I wanted to work
for the federal government or not.

02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.400
I was afraid I'd be put in a position
and not allowed to do anything.

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:51.600
And I have to say that I have a wonderful
boss.

02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:55.480
Secretary Pete is one of the best guys
in the world to work for

02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.640
and I have been having a lot of fun

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.200
being here because
they're letting me get so much done.

02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.400
So we are looking forward in this next year

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.800
to making a lot more changes.

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:15.480
Lastly,

02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:20.040
I want to address the taxicab thing
because we addressed a lot of stuff

02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.360
in these priorities and it's a very
it was a very aggressive plan

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.360
and we plan to complete them
by the end of this following year.

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:30.560
But well, all except for the wheelchair
spot on airplanes.

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.200
It's going to go well into 2025.

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:37.600
But I think the transportation

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:42.640
that I get the most complaints about
and everybody thinks sucks is paratransit.

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:46.320
Paratransit doesn't really work
for very people at all.

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:50.040
There's a small segment of the population,
I think

02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:52.880
usually people who

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.360
are still living with their parents and their parents

02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:59.480
actually are the ones that are satisfied with paratransit.

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.960
I’m not sure how many of the people
with disabilities actually are,

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.680
But it doesn't work well for everybody.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.680
So that's been a real problem.

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.440
The unfortunate thing with DOT.

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:15.280
is that we do not

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:18.600
fund paratransit,
we fund vehicles for paratransit.

02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:20.840
We don't really fund paratransit.

02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.960
So we don't have too much to say about it,

02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:28.080
but we do also issue a rule on
how they're supposed to be operated.

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:32.120
And so we are going to be looking at

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.520
and you'll probably see an announcement
that we're going to be putting out

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:38.680
a request for information, asking people

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.520
to chime in about paratransit.

02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:44.960
One of the things that we are
probably going propose is making it

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:48.280
a same day service
instead of 24 hours in advance.

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.640
There's a number of other things
that we're probably going to propose.

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:55.000
But anyway,

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.120
so the option to paratransit
for a lot of people is the cabs.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:02.920
And the port looked at the port
at the Americans

02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.520
with Disabilities Act back
after it was first

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.000
passed in 1990.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.080
And a lot of people who are as old as I am
will remember, when we passed the ADA

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.440
really paratransit was just to get us
until all the busses were accessible.

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:21.080
And then we figured everybody would ride

02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:22.440
the bus.

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.000
But that's not how it's working out.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:24.640
So we're

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:28.800
going to need to see how we can address
paratransit to make it a better system.

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:31.720
But they also looked at taxi cabs and.

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:36.200
I think from talking to people
within the department, really,

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:42.040
they made the decision
not to require lifts or ramps on taxi cabs

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.480
unless they purchase a van

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:47.440
because they didn't have enough.

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:52.120
I think they felt like
they didn't have enough

02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:57.280
expert expertise or experience or

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.520
the law was not clear enough
to make them feel like

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:05.840
they could make taxi cabs
to be required to be accessible.

02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:09.480
And they getting a huge amount of pressure
and pushback

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:16.240
from the taxicab industry, which back then
you remember that Uber and Lyft did not.

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.640
They did not exist yet.

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:21.280
And so taxi cabs were really
the only service like them.

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.560
And I shared with Ana, the

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:29.080
the little one pager
that sort of describes

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.960
what the department's decision was.

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.240
It's the preamble to the rule.

02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:36.560
So Ana if you could send

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.560
that as well as the slides that I sent you,

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:45.320
if you send those to the Council members,
I would much appreciate it.

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.440
And then with that, Emily,

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.880
I'm going to turn it back to you.

02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:52.960
CM VOORDE: Fantastic.

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:56.040
Kelly, thank you so, so much genuinely

02:05:56.040 --> 02:06:00.280
for the work that you're doing
and for that really robust update.

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:03.040
We have one final presenter

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:06.440
and then we will open up to the Council
for questions.

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:11.760
As a reminder, we have until 410 Eastern
time for both of those pieces.

02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:16.160
So about 15 minutes, at which point
we will pivot to our public comment

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.760
portion of the meeting.

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:21.000
And so our third,

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:23.080
but not certainly not least

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:26.560
last but not least panelist is Matthew Faiella,

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:31.080
a trial attorney in the disability rights
section of the US Department of Justice

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:35.680
Civil Rights Division. NCD continues
to hear from the community

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:40.480
that it's very difficult or impossible
even to get wheelchair accessible

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:44.360
taxicabs and wheelchair accessible Ubers or Lyfts.

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:49.160
NCD staff and Council members
also experience this when we travel.

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:53.520
We're interested in hearing what
federal law requires of taxi companies and

02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:58.320
companies like Uber and Lyft with regard
to providing wheelchair accessible vans

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:01.920
and the rights of people with mobility disabilities.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.320
We know, Matt, that you have been
greatly involved in this work.

02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:10.080
So we thank you and we thank you for your time here today.

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:12.880
I'll turn it over to you.

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:13.320
MATTHEW FAIELLA: Great.

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.240
Thank you so much, Emily.

02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:19.000
And thank you to Kelly and Juliett for your presentations.

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:24.000
I'm very honored to be here
and I will try to go as quickly as I can.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:28.720
First of all, I'll introduce myself, I'm Matt Faiella from DOJ.

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:32.480
I am a white I have brown hair, I'm
wearing a suit, and I have a blurred white

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.800
background behind me.

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.880
I am a trial attorney in the disability
rights section

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.840
or DRS at the Civil Rights Division
at the Department of Justice.

02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:49.440
And our mission at DRS is to advance
the nation's goal of equal opportunity

02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:53.440
integration, full participation,
inclusion, independent

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:57.760
living and economic self-sufficiency
for people with disabilities

02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:01.680
through enforcement,
regulation and technical assistance.

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:04.760
We work to do this by implementing the ADA.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:08.280
Section 504, the Genetic Information

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:11.960
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 or GENA,

02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:16.440
and our enforcement, regulatory
coordination and technical assistance

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:20.000
activities along with innovative mediation
program to provide

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:24.800
our multifaceted and dynamic approach
for carrying out our mission.

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:28.280
Today, I'll talk a little bit about the ADA’s

02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:31.920
general provisions that relate to transportation.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.920
I'll talk more specifically
about the provisions that relate to taxi

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:41.080
companies and transportation
network companies or TNCs,

02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:45.840
which are also known
as rideshare companies like Uber or Lyft.

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:48.120
I'll give some examples of our enforcement

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.080
work around taxis and TNCs,

02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:54.560
and then I'll finally let folks know

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.280
how to report a civil rights violation
to the Department of Justice.

02:08:59.360 --> 02:08:59.760
So to

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:02.800
talk about the ADA's transportation provisions,

02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:07.560
I'll mention that Title II of the ADA applies to public entities.

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.000
It also applies to Amtrak.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.840
So folks don't realize Amtrak falls under Title II

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:15.840
of the ADA as a public entity.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.040
Title III of the ADA applies to public
accommodations or private entities.

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:26.560
That includes private entities
that provide transportation services,

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:31.120
and both US Department of Transportation
and the Department of Justice

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.400
have issued regulations under the ADA. Kelly covered a lot of that.

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.080
DOT’s ADA regulations

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:44.080
that are relevant to taxi companies
and TNCs can be found at Title 49

02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:48.280
of the Code of Federal Regulations, in Parts

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:52.080
37 and Part 38.

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:56.440
Part 38 has vehicle specifications which

02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:01.240
would relate to the types of accessibility
requirements for vehicles.

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.920
Part 37 contains some broader
nondiscrimination protections.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
DOJ is responsible for enforcing Title III

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
of the ADA and Parts 37 and 38

02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.120
of Title 49 the Code of Federal Regulations.

02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:23.280
We've done that, and the examples
I'm about to give relate

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:29.080
to our enforcement of those
statutes and the regulations.

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.920
So the first example I'll talk about

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.480
is a settlement that DOJ reached

02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.480
with Chariot Transit , Inc.

02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:41.080
I'll give you a little bit of background

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:45.320
on the law and then I'll tell you
a little bit about the matter.

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.400
So to the regulation
that I was just mentioning

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:54.480
require that if a private entity
that's primarily engaged in the business

02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:00.600
of transporting people operates
a fixed route transportation service

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.560
and purchases or releases a new vehicle
other than an automobile or van

02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:09.760
with a seating capacity of less than eight
passengers, including the driver,

02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:14.440
that vehicle must be readily accessible
to and usable by individuals

02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:18.920
with disabilities,
including individuals who use wheelchairs

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
if it's not a fixed route system,

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.880
but rather a demand responsive system

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:29.160
and the transportation and the entity is

02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:33.320
primarily engaged
in the business of transporting people

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.520
and it purchases or releases

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.040
a new vehicle other than an automobile
or van with a seating capacity

02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:43.520
of less than eight passengers,
including the driver.

02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:46.880
That vehicle must be readily accessible
to and usable by

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.400
individuals with disabilities,
including individuals who use wheelchairs

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.520
unless the system,
when viewed in its entirety,

02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:00.640
meets the standard
for what we call equivalent service.

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.000
The regulations and the law
explain equivalent service

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.520
as a level of service to individuals
with disabilities, equivalent

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.280
to the level of service
provided to the general public.

02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:16.120
And that relates to things
like response time

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.120
fares, geographic area of service, hours
and days of service,

02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:24.000
availability of information, reservation

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
capability, any constraints on capacity

02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:32.440
or service availability
or restrictions based on trip purpose.

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:34.720
So I know I just

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.600
spouted a lot of regulatory information.
I just wanted to be clear

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:42.640
what the regulations require
and how they apply,

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.120
you may have noticed
that there is this language here

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.880
about the transportation service,

02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:52.840
purchasing or releasing a new vehicle

02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:56.760
other than an automobile or a van
with a seating capacity of

02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:59.680
than eight passengers,
including the driver.

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:06.240
So the vehicles that are at issue here
in these regulatory

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:10.520
provisions would be something bigger
than an eight person band.

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.240
And it has to be a new vehicle.

02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:15.360
These are purchased
by this kind of transportation entity,

02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.360
whether it's a fixed route or demand,
responsive.

02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:25.080
So that's the regulatory and legal background.
The Chariot Transit, Inc., matter

02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:28.600
involved a private transportation company
that provided a fixed route

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:30.440
and on demand service.

02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.080
It also leased or owned vehicles
that were not automobiles

02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:37.080
and did hold more than eight passengers.

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:41.760
The United States alleged
that Chariot did not comply with the ADA

02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:45.760
obligations to provide equivalent service

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:48.680
or to have its vehicles be accessible

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:51.360
by doing things
like telling people with disabilities

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:55.480
that the company only provided service
to individuals who use wheelchairs

02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.640
if they could transfer to a seat
and if there was space for the wheelchair

02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:02.640
that did not take the seat
of another passenger.

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:04.960
Those who required an accessible vehicle

02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:08.440
would only be provided
accessible resources in the region.

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.280
And so DOJ went into
a settlement agreement

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.560
after reaching out to this company,
the company agreed to begin operating

02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:20.480
sufficient accessible vehicles
to provide passengers with disabilities

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:24.760
with equivalent service, to not require
passengers with disabilities.

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:28.840
to not require passengers with disabilities to have a different manner for booking vehicles from other passengers,

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.680
to train the company's
employees on the ADA requirements,

02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:37.120
including requirements for accessible
vehicles and equivalent services,

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.200
and to pay the United States
the civil penalty.

02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.280
That was from around
seven or eight years ago.

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.600
Chariot Transit Inc.

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:49.680
A little bit more recently in 2020, DOJ

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.880
reached a settlement with a transportation
network company called Lyft.

02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:56.280
I imagine folks have heard of Lyft.

02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:01.400
This involves allegations
that Lyft was denying rides

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:06.200
or otherwise engaging in discriminatory
mistreatment, making rude comments

02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:12.040
to passengers with disabilities who use
wheelchairs or walkers or mobility aides.

02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.440
The settlement agreement required
that Lyft agreed to,

02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.240
require Lyft to make policy changes,
including an ADA compliant complaint

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:25.320
procedure to train its employees
and its drivers

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:28.360
in the ADA obligations to designate

02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:34.080
an employee to coordinate ADA compliance
to refund riders and pay $10 credits

02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:38.480
to those who make plausible complaints
of disability discrimination

02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.880
to pay tens of thousands of dollars
to individuals who had been aggrieved

02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:46.440
and complained to United States
about their mistreatment

02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.920
and to pay the United States a civil penalty.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:51.960
Under

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.120
that settlement agreement, not investigate
Asian.

02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.480
Lyft was covered as a private entity,
entity that provides taxi services.

02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.800
That's another provision within the DOT.

02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:09.160
regulations on this matter
and under Part 37

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.840
and private entities that operate these

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.440
transportation services have to ensure
that their personnel are trained.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.600
They have to provide their services
in a nondiscriminatory manner.

02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:24.760
They cannot refuse to provide services
to individuals disabilities

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:28.480
or refuse to assist
with stowing of mobility devices.

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.640
They can't charge higher fees or fares for
carrying individuals with disabilities.

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:35.560
And so

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:39.680
here I mentioned they also have
to designate at least one individual

02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:43.760
to ensure ADA compliance and have prompt and equitable

02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:46.840
complaint resolution procedure.

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.320
So that was the Lyft agreement from 2020.

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:53.680
Then in late 2021, the United States

02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.680
sued another TNC, Uber Technologies Inc.

02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:01.560
Again, I imagine folks have heard of Uber,

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:05.920
Uber had a practice of and a policy
of charging what they call wait

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:11.480
time fees to all customers,
including customers with disabilities,

02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:15.520
even If those customers may need more time
to board a vehicle.

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.080
than Uber was giving them, which was 2
minutes before the fee would be imposed.

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:24.920
So the United States sued Uber as
a private entity, primarily engaged

02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:29.040
in the business of transporting people
under the ADA

02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.920
for charging illegal fees,

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:36.560
for denying adequate boarding time,
which is something the ADA requires,

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:39.680
and for denying people
reasonable modifications

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:42.880
to the company’s wait time fee policy.

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:45.760
Uber did settle with the United States

02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.520
and agreed to change its policy
to allow people with disabilities

02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:55.240
and their frequent companion travelers
to opt in to a fee waiver program

02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:57.480
so that they wouldn't be charged
for individuals

02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:00.920
who don't opt in to that program
and are charged with time fees

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:06.120
because of disability,
Uber agrees to promptly refund them,

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:08.280
and it

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:13.120
agreed to advertise the program
to train its staff on the new policy.

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:16.200
It also agreed to provide payment

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.440
to over 65,000 individuals
who had been charged

02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:22.680
wait time fees likely due to disability, over

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:27.320
$2 million to individuals
who had complained

02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:30.760
to the United States or Uber,
and to pay the United States

02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:34.920
a civil penalty under a two year
settlement agreement.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.720
So again, those provisions

02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:40.720
about requiring equitable fares,

02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:45.800
about providing adequate boarding time
and requiring reasonable

02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:48.840
modification to policies
all come from different provisions

02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:54.600
of the ADA and from DOT's regulations
that the United States enforces.

02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:58.840
Also, in the Uber case,
the attorney general was

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:01.920
did commence the action on a determination

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.960
that Uber had engaged in a pattern
or practice of discrimination

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.120
and that a group of persons
had been discriminated against.

02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:14.960
And it rose to the level of raising
an issue of general public importance.

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:18.160
So we used that provision of the ADA
for our enforcement.

02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.840
I was part of the litigation team
in that case,

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.920
and I'm happy with the results
and hope that many people are now

02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.920
not being discriminated
against under that policy.

02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:36.760
So I'm giving those three examples of DRS’s and DOJ’s enforcement in the area of

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:37.560
providers of

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:42.120
transportation services
like TNCs or taxi companies.

02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.000
I did go over some of those regulatory provisions

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.880
relating to vehicle accessibility,
and we do have so much of our work

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:55.000
at the Disability Rights Section in that DOJ is complaint driven,

02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:58.600
meaning we really do
rely on the public to send us

02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:01.440
reports of discrimination.

02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:06.280
And so what I'm doing right now is sharing in
the chat to the host and panel

02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:08.920
It's the link
to our complaint reporting page.

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.680
So that any individual can file.

02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:14.520
If you believe that you are aware
of a civil rights violation

02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:15.800
under the federal law.

02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:21.280
So thank you so much.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.840
CM VOORDE: Thank you so much,

02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:25.320
Matthew, for your for your time.

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:28.720
And again, your your update
and your willingness to join us today.

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:32.240
And we are just one minute away from

02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:36.600
the time that we said that
we would pivot over to public comment.

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:40.320
I wanted to ask my fellow council members,
anybody has any burning

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:43.320
questions for our panelists,

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:51.160
Matt, Juliet and Kelly.

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:52.960
AC GORDON: Claudia,

02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:55.960
I do have a comment.

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:58.240
Let's see, did I lose Kelly or is Kelly

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:02.680
still here?

02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:04.240
I'll go ahead with my comment.

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:05.320
I know we're short on time.

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:09.040
First of all, thank you so much to

02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:10.760
first of all, thank you so much

02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:16.160
to all three of our presenters
and thank you for sharing

02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:20.320
about the important and focused work
each of your agencies are doing.

02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:24.360
And thank you for expanding
and covering so much ground

02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:31.000
in the transportation space. It's

02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:32.920
I guess I can only say

02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:35.800
positive things and at the same time

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:40.440
something that I just wanted to flag,
just to put on your radar,

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:42.560
maybe we don't have time for further discussion

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.160
today when it does come to transportation.

02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:48.360
Another accessibility challenge

02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:52.960
that's involved is for the Deaf
and hard of hearing community.

02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.960
So hopefully
that's something that you'll continue

02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:00.800
to be mindful of
and add in to all of these

02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.520
oppressive time

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:06.600
policies in regards
to physical accessibility issues,

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:11.080
in terms of wheelchairs
being lost and broken,

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.040
not being able to access the bathroom,
those are absolutely paramount.

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:17.960
But as a Deaf person myself,

02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:22.520
I can't tell you how many times
after my transportation,

02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:26.880
after my Uber or Lyft ride,
I get an email telling me

02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:33.400
that I have a low rating from the driver
and I'm wondering what I did.

02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:37.440
And it may be
that the driver was talking to me and felt

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:43.120
that I was rude or or unfriendly
and I have no idea what I did.

02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:46.440
And I and also I get threatened

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:49.840
with a ban
from these transportation platforms.

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:52.600
So lack of training

02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.000
is also
a barrier, just as you already know.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.680
The same thing with airlines
not having captions for announcements

02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:01.800
or flight delays or gate changes.

02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:04.760
There's no captions
or visual notification.

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:06.680
So I just wanted to bring that.

02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:11.360
But I am so encouraged by the work
each of you is doing in your agencies

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:17.120
and your ongoing work for all participants
today who are joining.

02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:20.000
Please continue to make

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.440
your voices heard and find the time

02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:26.520
to continue
to submit those comments and complaints

02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:28.400
that are a result, a direct result.

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:31.680
These results are from your willingness

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:35.000
to raise your voice
and share your experiences of barriers.

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:44.160
So thank you.

02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:45.320
CM VOORDE: Vice Chair Gordon.

02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:48.760
Sascha, did I hear you come off mute

02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:52.720
with a burning question?

02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:58.520
CM BITTNER:  I wanted to ask about the ridesharing --

02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:14.880
Annika?

02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:16.480
(-interpreter: I'm sorry.)

02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:17.360
(-interpreter: Give me one moment.)

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:21.000
(-interpreter: okay, go ahead.)

02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.440
I wanted to ask about the ride sharing.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.800
About the vehicles of the passengers.

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.440
With less than eight passengers.

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.120
My understanding
is you don't regulate those.

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:30.120
My question is what would be done
in order to regulate those.

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.880
What would need to be done.

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:42.400
If we don't answer it now.

02:25:46.760 --> 02:26:02.120
Maybe can talk to you offline.

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.120
CM VOORDE: We do have a moment,

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:07.320
if you want to take a chance to respond or if you

02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:10.920
if you'd like to connect with Sascha offline.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.640
BUCKLAND: I actually can respond quickly.

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:17.800
And then I will be happy to talk offline too.

02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:23.200
But the thing that I sent to Ana to send around

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.120
on taxi cabs was done in the 90s,

02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:27.480
right?

02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:31.120
The early nineties, right after the ADA.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:34.720
It's old, I mean the world is completely different place than it was

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:40.000
and Matthew, I think, could chime in on this too.

02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:40.680
The whole thing

02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.160
about when viewed in its entirety,
do they provide equivalent service?

02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:49.600
I think the answer to that today is no,
they do not provide

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.360
an equivalent service,
so I think they should be required to. So

02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:56.840
I don't know what the mechanism is to trigger it.

02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.040
Maybe Matthew could address that better.

02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.080
But I think the whole

02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:08.160
determination that

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.440
they didn't have to do

02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:14.320
make anything
other than automobile accessible

02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.360
or they needed to make everything
other than an automobile accessible,

02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:22.720
I think needs to be revisited because

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:25.720
Lyft and Uber didn't exist.

02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:27.360
None of that stuff existed.

02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.400
So I think that access
was completely different back then.

02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.400
So even accessible cabs,
I don't think they could even envision

02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:36.360
what's out there today.

02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:38.480
So I just think the whole thing

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.120
sort of probably needs to be revisited
and a new determination made.

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.920
But that's my take.

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:48.760
I’ll let Matthew chime in if he’d like.

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.120
FAIELLA: Hi, thank you, Kelly, and thank you Sascha for the question.

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:56.480
And yeah,
I think the regulatory requirements

02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.520
for accessible vehicles is fairly narrow.

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:02.440
As it’s written.

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.800
And as Kelly mentioned, doesn't apply to such a broad

02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:11.360
range, different kinds of vehicles
that exist now.

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:16.720
So certainly a change in the regulations
could help to fix that.

02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:18.840
I will point out that

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:20.160
in addition to the

02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:23.840
specific requirements
about accessible vehicles,

02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:27.480
we do have broader
nondiscrimination requirements

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:32.040
for private entities
that provide transportation services.

02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:37.400
So even if we may not be able to require
that they have an accessible vehicle

02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:42.720
if they don't lease or purchase a new non

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.880
automobile that has a capacity of

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:49.920
more eight

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.920
even if we can't get
to the accessibility of the vehicle,

02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:58.440
given the examples about Lyft and Uber
just to try to demonstrate that

02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:00.120
unfortunately there are many other

02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:03.800
kinds of discrimination
that people with disabilities may face,

02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:08.760
and we do stand ready to continue
to enforce the law in those situations.

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:13.080
And again,
folks can file complaints with us.

02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:15.920
We definitely want to know about

02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:20.160
what is happening
as the transportation involves.

02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:25.400
And as Kelly mentioned,
we encounter types of transportation

02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:28.920
that probably weren't
even thought about back in the 90s.

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:34.840
So please do continue to let us know.

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:37.120
BUCKLAND: Emily,

02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.960
If I could just real quickly,

02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:42.000
I'd like to respond to Claudia, but.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.280
Well, first of all. Hi, Claudia.

02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:45.680
Secondly, though.

02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:47.040
AC GORDON: Hi Kelly.

02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:48.880
BUCKLAND: I think

02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:52.560
there's a lot of things the department
has actually done to increase

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:55.920
accessibility for people who are Deaf.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:59.160
One of the things I forgot to mention
was that we have

02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:01.360
released at least $1 billion

02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:04.360
for airport terminal improvements

02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:07.920
and 75 of those 80

02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:11.400
grants were actually disability related.

02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:16.240
And a number of those added in visual signs

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:20.440
for gate changes, that kind of stuff,
audio loops in the airports,

02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:24.200
audio loops are going to be
on all of the new Amtrak cars,

02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:28.280
and there's going to be also captioned and

02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:31.920
visible signs in the train cars
that they're building as well.

02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:33.720
And so

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:34.120
there

02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:37.320
is a number
of things that we have done around

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:40.760
people with deafness
or hearing impairments as well.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.800
And the department
and the last thing I'll say is that

02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:49.480
when it comes to air travel,
I mentioned what the United Agreement was

02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:52.360
that they've started,
including captioning on both

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:55.360
in-flight communications
and even entertainment.

02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:58.920
But the other thing I didn’t mention is the next

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.560
you'll remember what we had a regulation
negotiation in 2016

02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:06.600
and communication in-flight

02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:09.600
communications
was the one thing that everybody agreed on

02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:12.920
and so that we only took up the wheelchair stuff first

02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:17.920
because people are getting informed
that to a greater degree.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.640
So one of the next NPRMs

02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:26.560
you'll come out probably like 2025,

02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:31.360
will be on in-flight communications and

02:31:31.440 --> 02:31:32.800
we'll a rule

02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:39.880
required that in airplanes at that point.

02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:41.520
AC GORDON: And thank you, Kelly.

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:44.200
And just wanted to say thank you for following up

02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.520
and it absolutely makes sense
to prioritize things in that way.

02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:51.040
So thank you. Emily?

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.080
CM VOORDE: No, thank you very much.

02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:54.800
And thank you once again to Matt, Kelly, Juliet,

02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:58.280
for your time and your candor

02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:01.320
in your ongoing work on these issues.

02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:04.440
My colleagues and I will be in touch
with follow up questions.

02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:08.840
I acknowledge that our time together
was shorter today than had been planned,

02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:12.400
and I once again
want to offer my sincere apologies for

02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:15.120
some of the delays
that that have pushed us up schedule

02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:18.000
and that have led
to technical difficulties.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.520
So thank you very much.

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:23.040
You're welcome to stay.

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:27.800
We're going to transition
now to our public comment period.

02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:29.960
AC GORDON: And Emily.

02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:33.480
I also wanted to add
I and and I want to emphasize,

02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:38.840
I know that there were there was important
information contained in your slides

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:42.240
and our Council staff
will ensure that everyone who came

02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:45.680
who came to today's meeting
will receive a copy of those slides.

02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:48.360
Thank you,

02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.640
Emily.

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:52.400
I'll continue to see the floor to you

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.880
to facilitate the public comment period.

02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:57.720
CM VOORDE: Fantastic.

02:32:57.720 --> 02:32:59.440
Thank you.

02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:03.280
Acting Chair Gordon.

02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:07.560
So pivoting to our public comment period,

02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:10.640
Once again, apologies
that we are running a bit behind, but

02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.840
want to be sure to prioritize
this and are eager.

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:18.080
We are eager to hear from those of you
who are joining us today.

02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:22.080
We're currently working, myself
included, on a policy project

02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:26.760
regarding the experiences of people
with disabilities in this country.

02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:31.920
And for the next 30 or so minutes, we have
five prompts on ground transportation

02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:37.960
that we're hoping to hear from the public
on those five prompts are as follows

02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:40.440
Please share your experiences in obtaining

02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:44.280
wheelchair
accessible taxis or ride share, i.e.

02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:47.440
Uber or Lyft.
Two, if you requested a wheelchair

02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:51.160
accessible van
or WAV through a taxi company.

02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:53.800
Did the company have a WAV?

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:56.760
If the company did not have enough
WAVs in its fleet,

02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:01.600
Did the taxi service offer to provide
you a WAV through a different company?

02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:05.440
Was the price comparable
to a non accessible taxi?

02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:05.880
Three.

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:10.080
If you requested a WAV from a rideshare company, did the company have a WAV?

02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:11.960
And if not, were you referred to a service that did?

02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:17.680
Was the price comparable
to a non accessible ride share

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:21.920
or have you filed a complaint
with the US Department of Justice

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.520
or the US Department of Transportation
about discrimination by a taxi company

02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:29.560
or ride share regarding lack of WAVs?

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.640
And if so, what was the result?

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:35.080
And finally, is paratransit
available your community?

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:37.840
What are the pros
and cons of using this service

02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:41.920
and what should be changed?
During this public comment period,

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:46.720
as is always the case,
we are going to need to adhere to a strict

02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:49.560
three minute limit for any comments
received.

02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:55.080
I will prompt you when you have 30 seconds left in your 3 minute comment period.

02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:58.720
Once called please state
your name, any organization affiliation

02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:01.840
and then proceed to provide your comment.

02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:02.440
We'll

02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:05.400
try hear from as many of you as possible.

02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:09.040
We're going to begin with those
who registered for public comment before

02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:10.360
turning to anybody.

02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:10.760
I'm sorry.

02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:12.040
We're going to begin with those

02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.880
who registered for public comment
before turning to anyone else on the line

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:19.160
with indicated
that they wish to give comment.

02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:22.840
You may do so by using the raised hand

02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:26.920
function in the Zoom program.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.160
If we run out of time today,
we strongly encourage anyone who did

02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:33.880
not give comment today with experiences
they'd like to share to

02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:38.080
please email their comments to the Council
at publiccomment@ncd.gov

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:42.080
so that we can incorporate your feedback,

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:45.880
your stories into our Mobility Disability
project.

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:47.800
Okay, So thank you so much.

02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.960
With that housekeeping,
we are going to turn to our official

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:56.800
public comment period
in starting up with Danica Gonsalves

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:59.640
from Paralyzed Veterans of America.

02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:02.360
Danica, you should be able to unmute and

02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:06.160
you have the floor.

02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:08.040
Hi, I'm Danica Gonzalves

02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:11.800
an advocacy attorney
at Paralyzed Veterans of America.

02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:15.760
And I'll be speaking on behalf of the PBA
members.

02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:20.040
PBA is a congressionally chartered
Veterans Service organization

02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:24.600
with nearly 16,000
honorably discharged veterans

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:28.000
who have incurred a spinal cord injury
or disease.

02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:31.720
Virtually all members
use mobility assistive devices,

02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.280
including wheelchairs, power and scooters.

02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:39.280
PBA members repeatedly experience

02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:42.960
a lack of wheelchair
accessible vehicles or WAVs.

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:46.080
Taxi or rideshare companies may have none.

02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:49.880
Or there are so few
they are not available when needed.

02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.200
This is even more prevalent
in rural areas.

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:58.600
Furthermore, despite ADA requirements,
emerging modes of transportation

02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.840
like autonomous
vehicles are not accessible.

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.120
The lack of WAVs is highlighted

02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:08.600
for transportation to and from airports.

02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:13.200
PVA members fly for hours,
then wait hours for a WAV.

02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:15.960
Sometimes it never arrives.

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.400
Travelers may be stranded
or forced to choose destinations

02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:26.160
with other accessible transportation
options. Beyond taxis and rideshares.

02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:31.200
PVA members also face barriers
with hotels and car rental company

02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:34.360
shuttles, which are frequently inaccessible

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:37.840
even when accessible ramps
may be inoperable.

02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:39.120
These shuttles are free,

02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:43.160
but customers are told they must find
and pay for their own transportation.

02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:47.520
And furthermore, some members use vehicles
with hand controls

02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.280
when they attempt to reserve
a rental vehicle with hand controls,

02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:55.280
they may be required to call the company
instead of booking online,

02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:58.320
the company may not offer
the accommodation.

02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:02.080
They are told hand
controls can only be installed in specific

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:06.920
types of vehicles or are required
to make this request days in advance.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.640
Customers without disabilities can reserve
a vehicle online, onsite

02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:14.520
and have access to a variety vehicles.

02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:17.240
In addition, renting a wheelchair accessible van

02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:19.800
is significantly more expensive.

02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:23.640
Mobility device users are excluded
from services, pay

02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.000
surcharges or face higher burdens
than those without disabilities.

02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:31.560
Paratransit service
raise additional transportation

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:36.400
burdens, services may be limited
in geographic areas and hours.

02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:39.360
Often,
a rider must book a ride days in advance

02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.160
without the option
for real time, reservations or changes,

02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:48.400
or they are given a large pickup window,
sometimes hours, and forced to book rides

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:53.480
hours before needed hope
and wait to see if there are unexpected

02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:56.680
cancellations or no shows overtaking.

02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:58.200
Danica, I apologize.

02:38:58.200 --> 02:38:59.640
Not a problem. Thank you.

02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:03.000
When member
a one member waited for hours in the dark

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.160
waiting for paratransit without knowing
if it would actually arrive.

02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:10.680
Overall,
even when paratransit is available,

02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:13.280
they failed to meet
the needs of passengers

02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:17.280
and do not provide equal transportation
services,

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:21.880
PVA thanks NCD for the opportunity
to comment on these critical issues

02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:25.520
and would love to be part
of the policy papers that are issued.

02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:28.160
Thank you.

02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:31.480
CM VOORDE: Thank you very much
Danica, I appreciate your comment greatly.

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:35.640
I want to pivot to Alex Elegudin from Wheeling Forward.

02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:39.280
Alex, you have the floor.

02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:40.520
PUBLIC COMMENT: Thank you so much.

02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.840
Can you guys hear me okay?

02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:44.400
CM VOORDE: We can, yes.

02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:48.760
PUBLIC COMMENT: I am super excited to be here and give comment on this.

02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:50.880
I'm going to be speaking a little fast
given our time.

02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:52.720
I hope no one's offended.

02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:55.720
I'm going to talk about
both the rideshare and paratransit

02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:57.600
topic, starting with the rideshare.

02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.080
I just want to introduce my experience
a little bit.

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.120
I'm not former accessibility
chief of MTA, New York City Transit.

02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:10.600
I'm also the former accessibility manager
at the New York City Taxi Limousine

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:16.440
Commission and serve as the accessibility director of Columbia University campus.

02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:21.560
So just want to I appreciate the comments
given by both Kelly and Matthew.

02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:26.280
On the rideshare issue,
I think there is a glaring hole in it

02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:29.800
which becomes clear
is that there's not enough regulations.

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:31.200
The regulations don't address this.

02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:32.760
And I want to clarify some of the facts

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:35.800
specifically as it relates to wheelchair
accessible taxis.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Uber Lyft only provide wheelchair
accessible service in nine

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000
cities New York City,
Chicago, Philadelphia, some others.

02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:45.760
That means 96% of the country
wheelchair accessible vehicles

02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:47.680
is not available in their platform.

02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:50.680
So whether you file a DOJ complaint

02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:55.040
in Oklahoma or somewhere else,
you will not get service.

02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:57.160
And there's nothing
they can do about the complaint.

02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:01.840
And the issue is actually, in my opinion,
not a matter of WAV availability.

02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:04.320
It's a matter of unwillingness
on behalf of the companies--

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:06.160
there are WAVs all over country.

02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:09.920
My estimation as an expert on
this is about 150,000 WAVs

02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:12.920
that are roaming around this country
at any given time.

02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:16.520
Wheelchair accessible vehicle,
even if a wheelchair accessible vehicle is roaming

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:21.440
the streets of Oklahoma
and wants to provide service to a customer,

02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:25.160
Uber Lyft do not allow them
to be identified on their apps.

02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:29.560
Uber, Lyft have fought numerous lawsuits
and won using their legal power,

02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:32.640
and these are all the reasons
why they make

02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:35.880
not providing WAV service
the cost of doing business.

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:39.480
Which is the reason why
what I'm saying and everyone here

02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:42.480
I think would agree the federal government
just needs to mandate

02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:43.560
that they have to do it.

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:45.240
It's an unwillingness issue

02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:48.120
and they've been skirting these rules
for more than a decade.

02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.480
On the topic of paratransit,
I want to talk about something

02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:54.960
a very policy consideration
that I've been talking a lot

02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:56.680
with the NCD and others about,

02:41:56.680 --> 02:42:00.600
is there's major capacity constraints
and this relates to Uber and Lyft

02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:04.560
providing service with regard
to random drug and alcohol testing.

02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:09.000
The USDOT and FTA require random
drug and alcohol testing,

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.360
which is the same standard that exists
for train engineer driving an Amtrak.

02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.360
A bus driver driving a bus

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:22.200
it’s the same standard that they hold for

02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:23.280
for an Uber

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:26.400
Lyft or taxi driver providing paratransit service.
To give you

02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:27.760
New York as an example,

02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:30.560
There's 120 thousand taxis,

02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:31.240
rideshares in New York City.

02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:34.440
But 5,000 participate
in the paratransit programs,

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:38.680
which limits the capacity of the program
because random drug and alcohol testing

02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:43.240
is such a high standard, Uber
and is a question of equity, not safety.

02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:46.960
If I am an able bodied passenger
ordering a Lyft

02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:50.440
or an Uber in New York City,
I can get the vehicle

02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:52.760
CM VOORDE: 30 Seconds remaining Alex, 30 seconds.

02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:55.640
PUBLIC COMMENT: No problem. Thank you Emily.

02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:57.480
This is a question of equity.

02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:01.440
If if a non wheelchair using customer or,

02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:04.880
non paratransit using customer requested
Uber or Lyft, they can get picked up

02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:07.960
because the regulations don't

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.760
match those same drivers
in Uber and Lyft or often

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:15.800
part time drivers cannot participate
paratransit service.

02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:18.800
So you're by having these rules

02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:22.200
that are somewhat artificial, in
my opinion, in place.

02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:23.760
You're limiting the capacity

02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:27.520
of hundreds of thousands of taxis to
participate in paratransit service.

02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:32.520
And if you think about it, my closing
comment is Uber, Lyft, billions of trips

02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:36.440
a year without requiring random drug
and alcohol testing

02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:40.160
for the non-disabled
non paratransit population base.

02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.720
But they do that because of the extreme

02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:46.720
regulation standard
that is applied to paratransit customers.

02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:48.760
And on that, I yield my time.

02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:51.640
CM VOORDE: Thank you, Alex. Appreciate it.

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:53.760
Next, I'd like to turn to John Morris

02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:57.400
from wheelchair travel dot org.

02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:00.480
John, you should be able to unmute.

02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:02.560
PUBLIC COMMENT: Thank you and good afternoon.

02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:06.000
My name is John Morris,
founder of Wheelchair Travel dot org,

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.760
an accessible travel website that is read
by wheelchair users and disabled people

02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:15.800
from across the United States
and around the world.

02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:19.120
I am a triple amputee and power
wheelchair user.

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:23.600
I travel frequently, taking
well over 100 flights per year

02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:29.520
and have done so since my first trip
as a wheelchair user ten years ago.

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:34.440
I encountered many barriers while
traveling throughout the United States.

02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.400
None more frustrating than the lack
of accessible ground transportation.

02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:44.360
The lack of wheelchair taxis has left me
stranded for long periods of time,

02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:48.600
in some cases overnight
in a list of cities that includes.

02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:52.200
But not limited to Cleveland. Dallas.

02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:53.840
Los Angeles.

02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:55.960
Orlando. Miami.

02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:58.080
Nashville. Tampa.

02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:01.080
San Diego and Saint Louis.

02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:06.800
I was once forced to sleep overnight
in a gas station parking lot

02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:09.640
over my ten years of disabled travel.

02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.600
Rideshare services
have expanded across the country in cities

02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:17.600
both large and small,
taking significant market share

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.840
and leaving traditional taxi companies
at a disadvantage.

02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:26.320
While ADA compliance
among cab companies was poor

02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:30.280
ten years ago,
it is significantly worse now.

02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.200
Wheelchair taxis
that previously existed no longer

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:38.320
do when calling for a wheelchair taxi
in many cities.

02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.400
Customers being told
the van is out for repairs.

02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:45.920
Where adapted taxis do exist.

02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:49.400
Most operators
require reservations of 24 hours

02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:54.880
or more in advance and only operate
during normal business hours from 9 a.m.

02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:56.320
to 5 p.m..

02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:00.080
Policies which restrict
the freedom of disabled people.

02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:01.800
Why is this?

02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:06.040
It's because ADA
taxis are not kept in continuous service

02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:11.120
but instead spend the night
at the homes of their daytime drivers.

02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.480
A small number of U.S.

02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:16.080
cities, fewer
than ten have gained concessions

02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:20.320
from rideshare operators
to provide accessible services.

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:24.360
However, those services
rarely operate around the clock.

02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.160
With few exceptions,
the availability of wheelchair taxis

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:33.560
has decreased significantly,
particularly following the pandemic.

02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:34.960
Pricing discrimination

02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:37.960
also serves as a barrier to taxi
transport.

02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:40.000
CM VOORDE: 30 seconds John.

02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:44.640
PUBLIC COMMENT: Wheelchair users desperate for a pickup
may be forced

02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:47.640
to pay above metered rates
to guarantee a ride.

02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:52.200
Even in large cities like L.A.,
where I observed this last year

02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:56.920
and in Nashville, where a taxi driver
attempted to extort me,

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.160
we need to update ADA

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:03.160
regulations to account
for the changing transportation economy,

02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:07.800
and I look forward to submitting more detailed
recommendations in written form.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.640
Thank you.

02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:12.760
CM VOORDE: Many thanks, John.

02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:16.840
I'd like to now pivot to John Sage,

02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:19.920
who is with Sage Inclusion.

02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:24.160
John, you should be able to unmute.

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:25.440
PUBLIC COMMENT: Great. Can you hear me?

02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:29.160
CM VOORDE: Sure can.
PUBLIC COMMENT: Wonderful, wonderful and

02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:32.200
honored that I get to follow my friend
John Morris.

02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:34.960
I'm John Sage. I'm
a manual wheelchair user.

02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:39.680
I'm CEO of three accessible travel companies
and I'm on the U.S.

02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:42.600
Travel and Tourism Advisory Board
advising the U.S.

02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:45.240
Secretary of Commerce
on accessibility issues.

02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:47.760
I'm the chairman that committee.

02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.240
And I know that the supply
and the need for this has has been

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.000
discussed a good bit.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.560
So I want to add a little bit
different context to it.

02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:59.600
And it's really my experience
in the travel industry

02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:02.840
as to how accessibility changes get made.

02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:07.520
And so what my experience has been
is that if disabled people

02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:12.760
advocating for accessibility,
there's only so much that can happen.

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:16.120
What really has to happen and is more

02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.560
effective is if you can get able bodied money

02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:22.120
dependent, you know,

02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:25.120
it becomes
dependent on things being accessible.

02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:27.080
So I'll give you a few examples.

02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:30.120
So one of the things that we put
in our recommendations to the U.S.

02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.120
Secretary of Commerce
was to use the purchasing power

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:36.640
of the federal government
to ensure accessibility.

02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:39.680
So President Biden, one of his first

02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:42.680
executive orders, talked about the workforce being

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:47.400
accessible and equitable
and right now, the federal government

02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:50.840
employees have to do a lot of work
on their own to plan their own trips.

02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:52.560
And so it's not equitable.

02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:53.920
And so that's something that

02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:57.880
that can happen, is use the purchasing of the federal government.

02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:02.200
I'll also say that events, meetings
and events,

02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:06.120
if we can get accessibility into RFP

02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:11.560
process, the request for proposal process,
where accessibility is

02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:14.280
one of the factors in determining
where an event

02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:17.440
or a conference sporting event or some big

02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:21.280
a big expensive occurrences is occurring

02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:24.760
that will get accessibility on the radar.

02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:28.960
And the last thing really is just
to to ensure, you know, the Department

02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:33.200
of Transportation ensure alignment
with the Department of Commerce.

02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:36.240
I think this is something
that can be tackled on

02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:39.720
multiple fronts and would really make some
some progress here.

02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:43.720
So I really want to thank the Council
and everybody involved for this.

02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:50.920
This is certainly a needed area
and I appreciate all this effort.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.480
CM VOORDE: Thank you very much, John.

02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:56.160
I'd like to pivot now. Carol Tyson.

02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:01.720
Carol is joining us from DREDF--the
Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund,

02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:02.880
PUBLIC COMMENT: Good afternoon.

02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.320
I'll be sharing anecdotes
gathered from DREDF friends and colleagues,

02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:11.040
as well as concerning trends,
regarding experiences with paratransit.

02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:15.120
Paratransit remains a critical option
for people with disabilities.

02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:18.840
Unfortunately, long and often
unpredictable wait times for pick up

02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.160
remain an issue.

02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:23.320
In addition, we have heard that adequate
time is not being given

02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:26.520
for passengers to get to the vehicle
that is picking them up.

02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:30.360
And when a paratransit trip
is a shared trip, it can be a 20 minute

02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.200
trip easily turns into a three hour
or even longer trip.

02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:38.040
These long and unpredictable wait times
combined with shared rides can lead to

02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:43.240
riders being late for or losing their jobs
or canceled medical appointments.

02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:43.920
We have heard

02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:48.160
instances of drivers taking actions
that lead to an unsafe atmosphere.

02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:50.160
Recently, a paratransit

02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:54.200
threatened to call the police when a rider
had difficulty leaving the vehicle.

02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:57.240
The transit agency
sent a warning to the rider rather

02:50:57.240 --> 02:51:01.440
than taking steps to ensure their safety
and well-being, that if it's concerned

02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:04.960
with any transit policy
which leads to unnecessary interactions

02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:09.000
between police and disabled passengers,
especially disabled black and brown

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.960
passengers are disproportionately harmed
in these interactions.

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:16.080
We have also heard on the flip side
that the social interaction

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:19.320
between the driver and passenger
can provide an important social

02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:23.320
connection for riders
who might otherwise be isolated.

02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:25.000
Regarding use of wheelchair accessible

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:28.320
taxis and transportation
network companies or TNCs.

02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:31.360
As I just noted,
Uber and Lyft only provide wheelchair

02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:35.440
accessible vehicles or WAV service in select markets.
In cities where WAV

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:36.600
service is not offered.

02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:40.720
Lyft provides a link on their website
to paratransit options in those markets.

02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:45.880
However, the link is broken and takes
user to a page that is no longer active.

02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:48.360
Many transit agencies partner witnesses,

02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:51.640
taxi companies to provide alternatives to paratransit.

02:51:51.720 --> 02:51:54.600
Unfortunately, we hear that
there are not enough WAV vehicles

02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:59.560
to meet demand. In Washington DC,
where WMATA partners with TNCs and taxis

02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:03.360
to provide a free on demand alternative
that is not a shared ride.

02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:06.760
We have heard that the service
does not provide Uber WAV vehicles

02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:10.400
because the staff would rather leave
the limited WAV vehicles on the streets

02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:14.400
for wheelchair users
who want to hail a ride in real time.

02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:15.240
In many areas

02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:18.240
where TNCs operate, transit
ridership has decreased

02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:22.200
and the numbers of taxis and wheelchair
accessible taxis has decreased as well.

02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:25.520
There are many studies
that show this that decreases in transit.

02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:27.560
Ridership can lead to cuts in transit
hours

02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:31.400
and routes can also lead
to cuts in paratransit service areas.

02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:34.680
In addition, New York City
recently implemented policies

02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:38.200
pushing to make taxi and TNC fleets
all electric.

02:52:38.280 --> 02:52:40.960
The current requirement
allows for gas vehicles

02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:44.320
to still be operated
if they are wheelchair accessible.

02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:48.640
DREDF is advocating for any alternative
fuel or cleaner transportation mode

02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:52.320
to also be fully accessible,
including to wheelchair users.

02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:55.680
Finally, Waymo is currently providing
autonomous on demand

02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:58.200
commercial service,
similar to Uber and Lyft.

02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:00.160
They claim their AVs are safer.

02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:03.720
Waymo does not offer an autonomous
wheelchair accessible vehicle option,

02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:06.720
nor have they shared plans to do so
in the future.

02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:11.080
Thank you again for the opportunity
to share and for all you do at NCD.

02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:13.600
DREDF looks forward
to supporting your efforts in these areas,

02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:17.440
and I'll submit my comments
in writing as well. Thank you.

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:19.560
CM VOORDE: Thank you much, Carol.

02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:24.600
I want to turn to our final
two pre-registered commenters.

02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:25.800
Thank you for your patience.

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:29.840
Kent Keyser I invite you to unmute

02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:39.160
and begin comment.

02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:39.640
PUBLIC COMMENT: Thank you.

02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:42.640
I'm Kent Keyser
with United Spinal Association.

02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:45.040
We thank the Council for all your work.

02:53:45.040 --> 02:53:50.080
Especially for those who like me,
must use a wheelchair to be mobile.

02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:53.120
My wheelchair travel
that I will share with you today

02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:57.960
is experienced daily around the country
of my fellow wheelchair users.

02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:02.560
I ask you to consider the barriers to ground transportation that

02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:05.280
people living in rural America confront.

02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:06.800
The Council's vision statement.

02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:11.520
very, very optimistically imagines
affordable and reliable transportation.

02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.800
for me. On behalf of America's

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:17.880
5.5 million wheelchair users
that United Spinal represents,

02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:18.360
we hope

02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:21.840
that you will also add safe, accessible
and

02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:24.600
on-demand transportation to your vision.

02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:29.960
I live in Northern Virginia, across the
Potomac River from our nation's capital.

02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:33.920
Even here, I don't have fully accessible
transportation.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.920
So let me answer your great questions

02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:38.640
to prove that point.

02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:40.320
In the past, I’ve requested

02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:43.200
a wheelchair accessible van--
WAV-- through my county.

02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:45.120
Arlington County’s taxi company.

02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:48.120
They have some WAVs,
but because they don't have enough WAVs,

02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.440
over the past 17 years,
I've been stranded for hour or more

02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:54.960
at times waiting to be picked up.

02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:59.920
Also, you must make a reservation
with them 2 hours early.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:00.960
This company is.

02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:03.120
Also one of Arlington's paratransit

02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:04.080
providers.

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:08.680
For whatever reason, a paratransit call
takes precedence over a regular call.

02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:11.400
So now I use paratransit exclusively.

02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:14.720
The bus system is great
if they stop where you want to go.

02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:19.720
The same for the Subway, except it
usually takes four good hearted strangers.

02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:21.720
To lift my wheelchair on board.

02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:23.120
one of the cars.

02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:27.880
The price on the taxi meter
may be the same price as non WAV taxis,

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:28.800
but the cost.

02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:32.280
Of my loss of valuable
as a human being waiting on

02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:35.280
rides is a tremendous difference

02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:38.280
to someone not requiring a WAV taxi.

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:40.560
When Uber announced it was

02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:43.840
providing Uber WAV in Washington, D.C. and

02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:47.480
in suburbs like Arlington, I tried.

02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:50.840
But my wheelchair didn't
fit in the vehicle. Routinely,

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:53.160
over the years, when paratransit fails me

02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:57.640
I've checked Uber WAV,
but none had been available at that time.

02:55:57.720 --> 02:55:59.760
I have not filed a federal complaint yet,

02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:03.520
but the clock is definitely ticking
because my paratransit service

02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:07.000
may be getting an overhaul
with a new provider contract.

02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:10.280
CM VOORDE: 30 seconds Kent, 30 seconds.

02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:13.640
PUBLIC COMMENT: Talk about the pros and cons and how it should be changed.

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.280
The 33 years
since ADA became law have been

02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:19.520
extraordinarily, technological advancements.

02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:23.800
Unfortunately, most paratransit services
have not adopted these useful tools.

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:26.360
Most notably providing on demand.

02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:29.640
service for most people in real time
vehicle location.

02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:31.880
So we don't waste time
waiting on our rides.

02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:35.600
Importantly, more efficient
scheduling reduces shared rides

02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:39.040
with nonsensical crazy distances
that wastes everybody's

02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:40.800
time, including the driver.

02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:42.960
And speaking of drivers.

02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:45.680
CM VOORDE: That’s time, Kent.

02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:49.360
I want to thank all of our
those who have commented today.

02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:54.040
I invite our commenters
and those who had wished to comment

02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:59.080
to please send along any comments
and notes by email to publiccomment@ncd.gov

02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:06.400
that’s publiccomment
--one word-- @ncd.gov.

02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:08.920
That concludes the time that we have

02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:12.720
allotted, unfortunately, for public comment.

02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:14.840
So I'm going to turn our floor back

02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:17.840
over to our Madam Acting Vice Chair

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:23.680
Gordon.

02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:24.960
AC GORDON: Thank you, Emily.

02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:30.400
Thank you for running
that important part of today's agenda.

02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:34.280
We had some wonderful speakers
and I also wanted to thank

02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.480
all of the individuals
who were involved with public comment.

02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:43.280
This is really the heart of NCD--
listening to our community.

02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:48.120
Listening to your counsel on our policy
and our programs and being able to pass

02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:51.840
that along to the federal government
and various agencies.

02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:56.680
So thank you
to all the public commenters from today.

02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:59.960
I will now turn it to our general counsel,

02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:04.240
Joan.

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:06.840
JOAN DUROCHER: Thank you, Madam Chair.

02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:14.440
AC GORDON: Yes, I know time is a little brief, Joan,
so I will just send it right over to you.

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.800
DUROCHER: Wonderful. Thank you so much, Madam Chair.

02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:18.080
I appreciate that.

02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:22.800
I'm Joan Durocher, NCD's
general counsel and director of policy.

02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:25.440
And for the first part of this

02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:29.320
policy report,
I'll be asking the Council member leads

02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:33.640
to give a very brief update
on some of policy work underway.

02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:38.200
I'm going to start with our clinical
trials report, which is nearly complete,

02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:40.880
but Emily will be giving the update
on that one.

02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:43.640
Emily

02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:44.680
CM VOORDE: Yes, apologies.

02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:47.200
Just give me one second

02:58:47.200 --> 02:58:50.960
to pull up my notes here.

02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:51.560
Okay.

02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:52.920
Fantastic.

02:58:52.920 --> 02:58:57.280
So the final draft of the clinical trials
report is under review

02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:00.880
and will be shortly ready
for a Council vote within the next weeks.

02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:05.040
The report addresses the implicit
and explicit exclusions of people

02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:10.400
with disabilities in clinical trials and
provides recommendations on how to improve

02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:12.800
acceptance and participation

02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:16.000
of people
with disabilities in the clinical trials.

02:59:16.080 --> 02:59:19.360
If you have any questions,
please reach out to myself

02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:23.480
or Amy Nicholas on NCD’s
staff on the project.

02:59:23.560 --> 02:59:25.200
Thank you so much.

02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:26.840
DUROCHER: Thank you, Emily.

02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:31.160
Next, our 2024 Progress Report is underway right now.

02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:35.200
Neil Romano is going
to be giving that update.

02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:36.720
CM ROMANO: Thank you, Joan.

02:59:36.720 --> 02:59:42.400
NCD will be drafting the 2024
Progress Report in-house.

02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:45.480
Through this more cost saving approach

02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:48.920
NCD will be able to draft an easy
to digest

02:59:48.920 --> 02:59:53.080
update to the President and Congress
on matters of disability policy and law.

02:59:53.160 --> 02:59:57.600
The report will provide an update
on progress made in the space of disability

02:59:57.600 --> 03:00:01.520
policy, while also making related policy
recommendations

03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:06.240
that remain necessary for NCDs
Statutory requirement.

03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:10.240
The report will include recommendations
on multiple subject

03:00:10.320 --> 03:00:13.600
areas as determined appropriate by NCD.

03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:19.440
NCD has begun initial chapter drafts,
and is planning to have a full report

03:00:19.440 --> 03:00:23.760
draft
ready for the Council vote this summer.

03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:25.720
Thank You Joan.

03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:27.920
DUROCHER: Thank you Neil.

03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:30.400
for the Health Disparities report,

03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.840
Theo Braddy is going to give that one.

03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:33.960
CM BRADDY: Thank you, Joan.

03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:36.360
I try to get through this pretty quickly.

03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:39.600
Since our last Council meeting
NCD has continued

03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:43.000
to correspond  with the administration and Congress concerning its

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:48.080
recommended  Framework to End Health Disparities for People with Disabilities.

03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:52.200
More specifically, since the policy
successes of the National Institute

03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:53.320
of Health

03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:57.040
designating people with disabilities
as a health disparities population

03:00:57.120 --> 03:00:59.880
for purposes of improved research
and data,

03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:04.560
the Department of Justice issued
a proposed rule on Title II of the ADA

03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:08.280
that aims to improve access
to medical diagnostic equipment

03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:13.080
for people with disabilities,
NCD has been particularly focused on a recommendation

03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:18.120
that disability, clinical care
and competency training be widely included

03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:22.240
in medical training and that people
with disabilities be identified nationally

03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:26.040
as a medically underserved
population under law

03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:28.680
NCD continues to brainstorm and collaborate

03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:32.920
with non-governmental organizations
that are positioned to have an impact

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.000
on the issue of disability,
clinical care and competency training.

03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:41.280
Councilwoman Voorde will discuss the need
for such training

03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:44.880
in a conference in March
sponsored by the Accreditation Council

03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:49.200
of Graduate Medical Education,
which will be attended

03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:52.560
by heads of residency program
from across the U.S..

03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:55.800
NCIL also continued a discussion

03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:00.320
with the Association of Medical Colleges
about potential efforts and NCD

03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:04.560
continues to meet with representatives of the U.S.

03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:08.320
Government Accountability Office
to provide policy advice with respect

03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:11.800
to disability clinical care and competency training

03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:14.720
of medical profession
and other health disparity

03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:18.960
policy matters
as the GAO like NCD

03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:24.000
will now be working to effect change
in these vital matters. Simultaneously,

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.640
NCD has been meeting
with Congressional representatives,

03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:31.520
non-governmental organizations
and health resources

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:34.480
and Service Administration
at Health and Human Services

03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:37.960
to determine
how best to deliver better health services

03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:41.760
to people with disabilities,
as would be done if people with disability

03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:45.360
were to be designated
nationally as a medical, underserved

03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:49.320
population under the law. NCD continues to weigh policy options

03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:53.240
and collaborate with the entities to determine best approaches.

03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:55.640
Thank you, Joan.

03:02:55.720 --> 03:02:56.320
DUROCHER: Thank you.

03:02:56.320 --> 03:02:59.800
Theo Next is Hoskie on the line?

03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:01.840
I think he is. Hoskie

03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:06.520
Benally is going to give an update
on the tribal lands work.

03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:06.880
CM BENALLY: Okay.

03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:08.760
Can you hear me?

03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:10.720
Right.

03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:12.280
Okay. Thank you.

03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:12.720
Yeah.

03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:15.720
This year NCD

03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:18.000
one of the biggest policy

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:22.920
projects is to develop a report
regarding barriers

03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:27.240
being faced by these Americans
with disabilities.

03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:30.240
And there's a group called

03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:36.120
the Intertribal Disability Advocacy Group,
which is comprised of several tribes

03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:40.560
across Indian country who were engaged

03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:45.120
in listening sessions
with Native Americans with disabilities

03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:48.120
to determine what the barriers are

03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:51.560
in the areas of education,

03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:56.240
medical services, voter rights,

03:03:56.320 --> 03:03:58.800
a number of other areas.

03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:02.880
And so NCD is going to be working
with this Intertribal group

03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:07.160
and the intertribal group has finished their listening sessions

03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:12.640
and are in the process of writing a report
that will be shared and

03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:16.080
reviewed with NCD, and then NCD will.

03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:20.440
work off of that report to come up with their own report.

03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:25.080
So that's what we have with tribal coordination.

03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:31.800
DUROCHER: Thank you, Hoskie.

03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:32.400
All the work.

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.480
I want to make sure to highlight is

03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:38.720
we recently submitted comments via
the interagency review process

03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:42.560
to the Department of Justice
on the Web accessibility final rule.

03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:47.480
And next week will be submitting comments
on DOJ’saccessible medical equipment

03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:50.560
NPRM and Ana has been the lead
on both of those.

03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:53.440
So a big thank you to Ana.

03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:55.280
FEMA issued an interim

03:04:55.280 --> 03:04:58.720
final ruling that will take effect
at the end of March.

03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:01.760
It will streamline
the intake process for disaster

03:05:01.760 --> 03:05:05.280
survivors and many of the new regulations
benefit people with disabilities.

03:05:05.280 --> 03:05:06.760
So that's some good news.

03:05:06.760 --> 03:05:09.760
NCD has been making those recommendations
for many years.

03:05:09.800 --> 03:05:13.280
So a big thank you to Amy,
who has been a lead on our FEMA work.

03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:15.640
From our panels today,

03:05:15.640 --> 03:05:19.080
you learned more
about our underway work on NCD’s mobility

03:05:19.080 --> 03:05:22.360
projects and our input into the Census questions.

03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:27.160
So the policy team has been rocketing
along on any number of fronts.

03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:30.600
And finally, we are in the process
of setting up a new subcommittee list

03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:31.440
for Council members.

03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:32.040
So please

03:05:32.040 --> 03:05:36.240
let me know if you have any interest
in any particular projects or topic areas

03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:41.120
and we can do some juggling
if needed as we go forward.

03:05:41.200 --> 03:05:43.160
So those the latest highlights.

03:05:43.160 --> 03:05:47.640
And now I want to give a very brief
overview of the report included

03:05:47.640 --> 03:05:52.040
in your notebook materials that I'm hoping
you all had a chance to read.

03:05:52.120 --> 03:05:55.400
The title of our latest report
is From Fetal Surgery

03:05:55.400 --> 03:05:58.920
to Gene Editing: The Current and Potential Impact

03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:00.840
of Prenatal Interventions on

03:06:00.840 --> 03:06:03.120
People with Disabilities.

03:06:03.120 --> 03:06:05.840
As Madam Chair mentioned,
this report is the next report

03:06:05.840 --> 03:06:10.840
in NCD’s bioethics series, which
the Policy Team started in 2019.

03:06:10.920 --> 03:06:15.280
We started the series because despite
the growing understanding that disability

03:06:15.280 --> 03:06:18.600
is a normal part of the human experience,
the lives of people

03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:23.080
with disabilities continue to be devalued
in medical decision making.

03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:26.160
In this series,
we've taken on several different topics,

03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:28.480
including organ transplantation.

03:06:28.480 --> 03:06:33.800
physician-assisted suicide, quality-adjusted life years,

03:06:33.880 --> 03:06:37.760
medical futility issues, and started
looking at genetic testing

03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:40.760
primarily through an employment
discrimination lens.

03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:45.720
This next report that you're voting on
today also looks at genetic testing.

03:06:45.800 --> 03:06:48.360
But here we've looked
at prenatal interventions

03:06:48.360 --> 03:06:52.640
that can include a host of technologies,
and applications, ranging

03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:57.040
from fetal surgery to repair of lesion
in utero or a baby with spinal bifida

03:06:57.120 --> 03:07:01.040
to pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis, screening out embryos.

03:07:01.040 --> 03:07:04.120
with certain conditions,
to human heritable genome

03:07:04.120 --> 03:07:09.160
editing to alter the DNA of an embryo,
to modify a genetic trait.

03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:10.920
All prenatal interventions

03:07:10.920 --> 03:07:15.680
ranging from fetal surgery to prenatal
genetic screening, to heritable genome

03:07:15.680 --> 03:07:20.840
editing, hearing unique practical, ethical
and disability rights implications.

03:07:20.920 --> 03:07:24.880
These technologies
required guidance from policy experts,

03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:29.520
scientists, medical providers,
disability and social justice advocates,

03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:33.520
researchers, bioethicists
and other experts.

03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:36.640
The report that we are issuing
now identifies

03:07:36.640 --> 03:07:40.280
the possible impact of these technologies
on the disability community

03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:44.080
gathers input about recommended
policies and practices

03:07:44.160 --> 03:07:47.880
so that any prenatal technology
developed and utilized

03:07:47.960 --> 03:07:51.240
are determined by including people
with disabilities as decision makers

03:07:51.240 --> 03:07:55.440
who have experience living with various
prenatally diagnosed conditions

03:07:55.520 --> 03:07:59.920
and aims to provide recommendations
to answer any prenatal intervention

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.880
do not disproportionately harm people
with disabilities.

03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:06.800
As a historically marginalized population.

03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:10.200
Each report in the series,
including this one, examines how

03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:14.800
these areas are developing as a result
of technological and scientific advances,

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:18.600
as well as changes
to the law and health care delivery.

03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:20.760
A combination of original research,

03:08:20.760 --> 03:08:24.000
stakeholder and scholar interviews,
literature reviews,

03:08:24.200 --> 03:08:27.080
reviews
and media reports and legal analysis

03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:30.320
where appropriate, is used to examine
each topic.

03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:34.080
As always, each report includes findings
based on these thorough examinations

03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:38.200
and makes recommendations
to lawmakers, policymakers

03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:40.400
that we hope will ensure the lives of people
with disabilities

03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:43.800
are valued on an equal basis with others
and will allow for people

03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:47.880
with disabilities to make health care
decisions in a non-coercive environment

03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:51.520
that respects dignity, privacy
and autonomy.

03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:54.080
I would be remiss if I did not thank Stephanie Meredith

03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:59.040
who did her doctoral practicum with NCD
by researching and writing this report.

03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:00.800
She did an extraordinary job on this.

03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:03.800
I hope you all had an opportunity
to read it, the fabulous report.

03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.200
And with that,
I turn it back over to Madam Chair

03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:13.400
to call for a vote.

03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:15.000
AC GORDON: Thank you very much, Joan.

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:19.400
And thank you to everyone
for your report outs.

03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:23.080
This incredible work is happening
in all these different areas.

03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:29.200
Thank you
from a very small team. So kudos.

03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:33.080
We will
move forward with calling for a vote

03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:38.640
on From Fetal Surgery
to Gene Editing: The Current and Potential

03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:43.240
Impact of Prenatal Interventions
on People with Disabilities.

03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:48.840
CM BITTNER:  I move that we accept the report.

03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:49.320
AC GORDON: Thank you.

03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:51.400
Sascha.

03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:57.920
Do I have a second?

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.600
CM ROMANO: Second.
AC GORDON: Thank you, Neil.

03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:05.160
Now that we have our motion
and our second,

03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:11.560
I will call Miss Lewis
to take a roll call vote.

03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:14.560
LEWIS: Thank you.

03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:17.560
Calling Vice Chair.

03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:19.320
Acting Chair.

03:10:19.320 --> 03:10:24.080
Madam Claudia Gordon
AC GORDON: Aye.

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:27.400
LEWIS: Hoskie Benally?

03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:31.640
CM BENALLY: Aye.
LEWIS: Sascha Bittner

03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:33.920
CM BITTNER: Aye.

03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:37.600
LEWIS: Theo Braddy?
CM BRADDY: Yes.

03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:47.480
LEWIS: Shawn Kennemer?

03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:54.440
Shawn Kennemer proxy?

03:10:54.520 --> 03:10:57.480
Risa Rifkind?

03:10:57.480 --> 03:10:58.920
CM RIFKIND: Aye.

03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:02.600
LEWIS: Neil Romano?
CM ROMANO: Aye.

03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:05.200
LEWIS: Emily Voorde?
CM VOORDE: Yes.

03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:09.480
LEWIS: I yield the floor back to you Vice Chair,

03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:16.960
Acting Chair, Madam Claudia Gordon

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:18.840
AC GORDON: Okay, thank you.

03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:21.280
And one quick and final topic.

03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:24.480
I wanted to suggest
we will go right over to Anne in a moment,

03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:27.880
but this topic is related to

03:11:27.960 --> 03:11:31.840
the Council members and our timekeeping.

03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:32.320
As you

03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:36.160
know, we need to document
and report our time for compensation.

03:11:36.240 --> 03:11:42.280
And I know it's been a challenge
in some areas in regards to the process,

03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:45.840
the paperwork platform issues,

03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:51.360
and I have specifically asked
Anne on how we can iron out this process

03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:57.120
for our Council members to ensure
we are compliant with the regulations

03:11:57.200 --> 03:11:59.920
as well as

03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:01.120
keeping us accountable

03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:05.240
since many of us have full time jobs
in addition to our role here.

03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:08.520
So the question was looking also at how

03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:11.800
we can get more support from staff at NCD.

03:12:11.880 --> 03:12:16.680
And I wanted to thank Anne for her time
and attention and investment in trying

03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:21.760
to solve this pain point in order
to increase the efficiency of our work.

03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:22.960
So I will turn it over

03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:27.880
to Anne to give a brief update on what
the future of timekeeping will look like.

03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:29.920
EXEC DIR SOMMERS MCINTOSH: Thank you, Madam Chair.

03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:32.520
Just so a quick one.

03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:35.520
We talked internally about this,
as Claudia mentioned,

03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:40.160
and what we want to do
is ease the pain and ease the burden.

03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:43.840
So you were told
in your orientation process

03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:47.880
that all members every two weeks
needed to turn in two things.

03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:52.320
They needed to record their time
in HR Links

03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:56.200
and we've been doing trainings to that

03:12:56.280 --> 03:12:59.040
to effectuate that
with Netterie playing a leadership

03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:03.960
role on that front
and that you also needed to turn in an

03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:07.640
SGE Excel sheet,
noting the days that you worked

03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:11.000
SGE standing for special government
employee.

03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:13.320
And you may remember you may not,

03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:17.360
that during orientation
you received a memo in your materials

03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:22.960
regarding what
special government employees timekeeping

03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:26.800
why we need to kind of
keep a count of days so you don't work

03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:30.840
past the 130 day limit
that you have in a year.

03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.680
And so if you need any more information
on day counting, we can get with you

03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:38.640
offline, Joan can go over any questions
you have about that particular memo

03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:40.560
or that particular process.

03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:44.320
But what we wanted to come back to you
with as a solution that we hope

03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:48.120
will at least begin to ease
the burden is going forward

03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:50.280
for any members who are not billing.

03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:52.560
And some some members choose not to.

03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:57.000
For any members who are not billing,
they can simply email once a pay period.

03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:01.520
When Stacey sends his reminder out
and tell Stacey the days they worked.

03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:05.160
So they just all they need to do is hit reply to Stacey's email

03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:07.400
and report the days that they worked.

03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:10.800
From there,
the AFO team will take the information

03:14:10.800 --> 03:14:15.720
and populate the SGE report for the
individual member so you no longer need,

03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:16.920
if you're not billing,

03:14:16.920 --> 03:14:20.800
you no longer need to enter
any information in the SGE report

03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:23.440
and you don't need to enter your time
in HR Links

03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:28.000
since you're not billing. For members
who are billing their time,

03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:34.200
whether through HR Links or in some cases
because of accessibility or security reasons,

03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:37.400
there are a few of you
who are doing it through paper form.

03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:41.160
For those
of you who are billing your hours,

03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:43.400
all you need to do is bill your hours.

03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:46.400
So every two weeks enter your time

03:14:46.480 --> 03:14:49.400
whichever way you're doing it currently,
if you're doing it through HR Links,

03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:51.240
continue doing it through HR Links.

03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:55.320
If you're doing it through paper form
with the AFO team

03:14:55.320 --> 03:14:59.800
because of security or accommodations
reasons, continue doing that.

03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:03.440
Staff are going to take the next step

03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:08.120
and translate the information
from your timesheet into the report.

03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:12.880
So the big ticket takeaway from
this update is no more SGE reports.

03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:17.400
If you're giving us your time,
we will populate the SGE information for you.

03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:20.680
You no longer have to do that yourselves.

03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:22.800
And if and then we just also

03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:25.880
wanted to emphasize if members
are having access issues with HR

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:29.800
Links and you need staff to enter
the time for you.

03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:31.240
Like if you if you have been

03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:34.240
having accommodations issues
or if you've never taken the plunge

03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:38.800
to experience the joys of HR Links,

03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:40.640
most of you will know.

03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:42.720
thank you Theo--

03:15:42.720 --> 03:15:47.080
HR Links is a painful, torturous,
horrible time keeping system,

03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:51.400
but unfortunately, we are constrained
to use it because of our HR

03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:56.480
Vendor and so we don't have a say so
in changing the software, unfortunately.

03:15:56.560 --> 03:15:59.920
So for those of you
who continue to struggle with it

03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:03.160
or sometimes even the staff have issues,

03:16:03.240 --> 03:16:06.680
you know, we don't expect to,
but we log in and we can get through.

03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:09.720
We're getting a spinning wheel
or we're getting error issues.

03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:10.800
If that's the case,

03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:14.400
just reach out to the staff
and we'll do our best to assist you.

03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:16.240
You know, we'll do a flyover.

03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:18.120
We'll give you air support.

03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:21.520
So we want to just re communicate to you.

03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:25.720
It would be extremely helpful
to us to get real time timekeeping,

03:16:25.800 --> 03:16:27.600
because then we're not dealing
with surprises,

03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:31.560
especially in C.R. periods of time
where we have such a small budget

03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:33.360
that we're working with.

03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:37.720
And it helps us to kind of keep
a real time accounting of the hours

03:16:37.800 --> 03:16:41.560
and also identify problems
as they're coming up as close to real time

03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:44.920
as possible because we have had issues
with that as well.

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:48.000
And so again, a big message

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:51.360
is no more SGE reports,
as long as you're providing

03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:55.160
those real time, time keeping,
we will take care of the rest.

03:16:55.160 --> 03:16:57.960
If you're not doing billing,
you have nothing to do

03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:01.240
except tell the staff
what days you worked.

03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:02.600
That's a

03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:05.120
and we'll take it from there

03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:08.440
and then just again,
if you have any additional

03:17:08.520 --> 03:17:11.720
links, training needs, troubleshooting
needs reach out to Netterie,

03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:13.800
she's very happy to help

03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:17.360
and going forward--Shawn couldn't be at this meeting unexpectedly

03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:21.600
but he has decided to take it upon himself
to do some individual outreach

03:17:21.600 --> 03:17:26.280
to members to find out what is
and isn't working with them, and also

03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:30.600
try to bridge the gap
to the extent that we have more work to do

03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:34.440
on addressing any policies or procedures
to make it even less painful.

03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:38.320
But we're hoping that this interim step
will at least get us moving in the right

03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:39.520
direction.

03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:42.240
Happy to fill any questions?

03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:43.720
CM BRADDY: No, this is very helpful.

03:17:43.720 --> 03:17:50.880
Thank you very much.

03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:53.200
SOMMERS MCINTOSH: And I yield things back to you.

03:17:53.200 --> 03:17:55.760
Madam Chairwoman.

03:17:55.760 --> 03:18:00.520
AC GORDON: Thank you, thank you Anne for providing
that clarification for everyone.

03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:03.480
We greatly appreciate your assistance.

03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:04.040
Okay.

03:18:04.040 --> 03:18:06.880
LEWIS: Madam Chair, this is Netterie.

03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:12.080
I just have one comment to make
because I know there has been issues

03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:17.560
with Council members
who said they submitted their time in HR

03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:19.640
Links but they weren’t paid.

03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:22.840
So if i can just reiterate for those

03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:26.640
that are submitting their time in HR Links,

03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:29.720
if you can just ensure

03:18:29.760 --> 03:18:34.680
that someone from the AFO Team, either myself or

03:18:34.680 --> 03:18:37.920
Mr. Brown is aware so it could be approved.

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:39.880
So the only reason ,

03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:43.440
and I know Emily,
this happened to you, the only reason

03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:48.280
you did not receive payment
because your time was not approved.

03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:52.560
So after I approved it and then notified
GSA you were paid.

03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:56.360
So if anyone submitted their time in

03:18:56.480 --> 03:19:02.480
HR Links, if you didn't receive confirmation
that your time has been approved,

03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:06.600
please notify either myself or Stacey Brown,

03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:17.640
so we can look into HR Links to ensure
your time has been approved for payment.

03:19:17.720 --> 03:19:19.720
SOMMERS MCINTOSH: So everybody.

03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:21.000
And I'll just add one more thing.

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:24.000
I'm sorry, Claudia

03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:27.000
HR Links is great sending auto emails too.

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:30.280
So if you have, i think

03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:33.440
as a translation on the practical side,

03:19:33.440 --> 03:19:36.440
HR Links will send you a donotreply@hrlinks.com

03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:41.160
or something like that email
as soon as they record your time.

03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:43.280
And so as soon as enter it

03:19:43.280 --> 03:19:46.880
you should be getting one of those
do not reply emails

03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:50.800
and you should also be getting one
when your time has been approved.

03:19:50.880 --> 03:19:54.440
We will do on our end a sweep because it's

03:19:54.480 --> 03:19:58.440
it would be great if you did send an email
if you don't get an approval email.

03:19:58.440 --> 03:20:03.880
But we also on the staff side will begin
checking proactively your behalf

03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:07.600
to make sure that if anything is entered,
that it is approved timely.

03:20:07.680 --> 03:20:11.400
So we'll circle back
with some more details in the email form.

03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:13.640
Just to kind of reiterate
what was said here.

03:20:13.640 --> 03:20:16.880
But again, hopefully we'll start

03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:19.440
experiencing less pain going forward.

03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:25.640
So thank you, everybody.

03:20:25.720 --> 03:20:27.240
AC GORDON: All right.

03:20:27.240 --> 03:20:28.240
Thank you again Anne.

03:20:28.240 --> 03:20:31.880
And so now we are
at the end of our meeting.

03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:37.000
Thank you to everyone for your patience
and for bearing with us this far.

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:41.760
I notice our numbers are declining,
so I did want to thank everyone who have

03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:46.080
who had participated with us today,
who bore with the technology issues.

03:20:46.080 --> 03:20:49.400
Thank you so much for your patience.

03:20:49.480 --> 03:20:53.840
Lastly, I would just like to ask
if there's any business

03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:55.680
Seeing none,

03:20:55.680 --> 03:20:58.320
no new business
or issues from Council members,

03:20:58.320 --> 03:21:02.800
then I would move to formally close
the public portion of the meeting

03:21:02.880 --> 03:21:09.760
and enter into our closed session.

03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:14.800
Do we need a motion to close or

03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:15.680
SOMMERS MCINTOSH: Madam Chair?

03:21:15.680 --> 03:21:18.680
We will

03:21:18.720 --> 03:21:22.920
You will ask for the motion to adjourn
the meeting from the closed session.

03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:26.480
And at this time
we can say goodbye to everybody and

03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:29.640
and ask staff to depart
and the public to depart.

03:21:29.640 --> 03:21:37.000
And we will enter into a closed
session once we are able.

03:21:37.080 --> 03:21:39.600
AC GORDON: Okay,

03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:42.040
well, you've
all received the instructions from Anne.

03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:44.520
So I guess

03:21:44.520 --> 03:21:48.880
what we're doing right now
is there's no motion to adjourn,

03:21:48.960 --> 03:21:52.440
but I will ask everyone
to go ahead and step out.

03:21:52.440 --> 03:21:53.520
Thank you so much.

03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:57.720
