PUBLIC COMMENT:

Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you—individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council's attention issues and priorities of the disability community. For the May 12 Council meeting, NCD will designate its half-hour of public comment exclusively for receiving information for its upcoming report that examines the impact of extreme weather events and environmental injustice on people with disabilities. In order to develop NCD's recommendations to policymakers, NCD invites you to share your insights in response to the following questions:

1. What are the barriers to accessing federal or state funding after a disaster? What needs to be improved?
2. With the increase of extreme weather events, what are the unique obstacles people with disabilities face in planning, response and recovery from these events?
3. What unforeseen obstacles will the disability community need to address because of the increase of extreme weather events? Recommendations on how those obstacles can be mitigated?
4. What role can the federal government play to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on people with disabilities?
5. What impact has the lack of environmental justice had on communities, specifically, the prevalence of disability? Can you provide specific instances of the impact to these marginalized communities? (e.g. Territories and American Indian/Alaskan Native lands)

Because of the virtual setting, there will be a hybrid option for submitting public comment. The Council is soliciting public comment by email or via video or audio over Zoom. Emailed public comment submissions will be reviewed during the meeting and delivered to members of the Council at its conclusion. You can also present public comment during the session by clicking the “Hand Raise” button in Zoom and waiting to be called on. If you plan to present over Zoom, please provide advance notice. To provide comments or notice to present public comment, please send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Submission should be received no later than May 11 to ensure inclusion.
