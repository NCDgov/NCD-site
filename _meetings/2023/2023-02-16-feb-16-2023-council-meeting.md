*Public Comment:* Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you—individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council's attention issues and priorities of the disability community.

For the Feb. 16 Council meeting, NCD requests comments from the public regarding areas of priority focus for the Council's Fiscal Year 2024 Progress Report, which is NCD's statutorily required report to Congress about the status of people with disabilities in the U.S. The report for which NCD is requesting comment will be researched and written in Fiscal Year 2024 and released in October 2024.

Because of the virtual setting, there will be a hybrid option for submitting public comment. The Council is soliciting public comment by email or via video or audio over Zoom. Emailed public comment submissions will be reviewed during the meeting and delivered to members of the Council at its conclusion. You can also present public comment during the session by clicking the “Hand Raise” button in Zoom and waiting to be called on. If you plan to present over Zoom, please provide advance notice. To provide comments or notice to present public comment, please send an email to *[PublicComment@ncd.gov](mailto:PublicComment@ncd.gov)* with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email.
