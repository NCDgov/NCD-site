**PUBLIC COMMENT:** Your participation during NCD’s public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you -- individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community, and help inform open research projects the Council has underway as well as the potential for future ones.

For the November 16 Council meeting, NCD will have two town hall format public comment sessions focused on housing concerns and opportunities, and transportation concerns and opportunities for people with disabilities. Commenters will be limited to three minutes each to accommodate as many comments as possible. Additional information on specifics of the topic is available on NCD’s public comment page at <https://ncd.gov/public-comment>.

The Council will prioritize in-person commenters, but as time permits, will also receive public comment by video or audio over Zoom, and always accepts advance public comments via email. Due to the hybrid nature of the event, in-person presentations will be given priority.

To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting in any form (in-person or by Zoom), NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to [PublicComment@ncd.gov](mailto:PublicComment@ncd.gov) with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is November 14, 8:00 p.m. EST. Please indicate if you are providing the comment in-person, over Zoom, or only submitting via email. All individuals desiring to make public comment are strongly encouraged to read NCD’s guidelines for public comment in advance of the meeting at: <https://ncd.gov/public-comment>.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to experiences with housing concerns and opportunities for people with disabilities.
