Additional information on specifics of the topic is available on NCD's event page at *[https://ncd.gov/​events/​2023/​upcoming-council-meeting](https://ncd.gov/events/2023/upcoming-council-meeting).*

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom.

NCD now requires advanced registration to provide public comment during a Council meeting. Interested parties may register by sending an email to *[PublicComment@ncd.gov](mailto:PublicComment@ncd.gov)* with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and a brief summary of the comments you intend to make in the body of your email.

NCD will call upon as many individuals who registered as possible as time permits. All individuals called on to make comments will be allotted three minutes to speak and then will be asked to stop. Due to time constraints, NCD makes no guarantee that those who register will be able to provide comments during the public comment session, however, all public comment submissions sent via email will be collected and provided to the Council at the conclusion of the meeting. While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to genetic editing and fetal medicine, as the input is needed for an upcoming report. If commenters speak on another topic at the meeting, they will be asked to stop out of courtesy to those who came prepared to speak on the topic. If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments but did not register.

*For those interested in commenting, please read the guidelines in full. Advanced registration is required.*

**General Background:**

NCD welcomes the input of the public throughout the year to help inform the Council Members of concerns of the disability community so that their research and recommendations to policymakers reflects the priorities of the community. At any time, individuals and organizations may submit public comment on any topic of concern to [PublicComment@ncd.gov](mailto:PublicComment@ncd.gov).

Four times a year, NCD hosts quarterly Council meetings, during which NCD designates a period of time to receive public comment, either in-person, or via audio or visual through Zoom virtual meeting platform. For these meetings, NCD often selects a topic on which to receive targeted public comment, usually in line with a project that the agency has underway.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Advanced registration is required to make public comment at a quarterly meeting.** To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to [PublicComment@ncd.gov](mailto:PublicComment@ncd.gov) with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is the night before the meeting, by 8:00 p.m. EDT. All individuals desiring to make public comment are strongly encouraged to read NCD’s guidelines below for public comment in advance of the meeting. 
2. **NCD cannot guarantee all who register will be called upon.** NCD will call upon as many individuals who registered as possible as time permits. However, all public comment submissions sent via email will be collected and provided to the Council at the conclusion of the meeting.
3. **All individuals called upon to make comments will be allotted three minutes to speak.** Due to time constraints, at the end of three minutes, individuals making comment will be asked to stop speaking.

While public comment may be submitted on any topic over email, comments received during NCD meetings should be specific to the topic selected for the meeting. Those who make comments on topics other than the selected topic may be asked to stop speaking. 
6. **If there is time remaining, those who did not register can indicate interest in being selected to speak and may be called upon at the discretion of the agency**

**Additional Details for May 4 Public Comment Session:**

**Asking the Disability Community: What are the ethical bounds of using medical interventions to prevent disabilities prenatally?**

NCD is currently undertaking research on the concepts, history, arguments, science, and consequences of fetal medicine interventions and future germline editing on the lives of unborn people with disabilities. NCD recognizes that disability is a cultural identity for many people, and we are undertaking this project in recognition of that identity and to ensure it is preserved as technology continues to advance.  

The report will be the next installment in [NCD’s Bioethics series](https://ncd.gov/publications/2019/bioethics-report-series), begun in 2019. Germline editing is technology that changes the DNA in an egg, sperm cell, or early embryo to prevent a disability from occurring. This technology could change the DNA of every cell in a human so that the disability is removed entirely from the individual and also removed from their reproductive cells for future generations. This technology could also be used to cause a disability to occur. This could include any range of conditions determined to be disabilities, such as Tay Sachs disease, Down syndrome, Deafness, dwarfism, or blindness.

Fetal medicine is a medical intervention while a baby is in the womb that can help prevent certain disabilities or lessen the impact of issues related to disability. For example, fetal surgery can be used prenatally for some babies with Spina bifida to close the opening in the baby's back to reduce the need for a shunt and improve chances for walking.

The proposed research will seek opinions from experts in biomedicine, genetics, fetal medicine, disability rights law, biomedical ethics, and disability stakeholders (including people with these disabilities as well as parents of children who have prenatally diagnosed disabilities and inheritable diseases).

We have reserved an hour to receive comments. Those who intend to make comments should familiarize themselves with NCD public comment guidelines below in advance of the day for comment.

NCD desires public comment in response to the following questions:

**Questions:**

1. What impacts do advances in the gene editing and fetal medicine technologies have for the future of the disability community?
2. Which of these technologies do you think are completely out of bounds, should be used with parameters, or should be used regularly?
3. If you indicated that any of the technologies should be used with parameters, what legal and ethical parameters should be put in place to make sure the use of the technology is equitable toward people with disabilities? 

**Definitions for use with the questions:**

* **Germline gene editing** – technology that changes the DNA of every cell in a human so that the disability is removed entirely from the individual and also removed from their reproductive cells for future generations. This could include any range of conditions determined to be disabilities, such as Tay Sachs disease, Down syndrome, Deafness, dwarfism, or blindness.
* **Somatic gene editing** – technology that changes the DNA of some cells in an individual but not their reproductive cells. Examples would be correcting the blood cells in people with Sickle cell anemia to improve health outcomes or retinal therapy to remove blindness.
* **Fetal medicine** – medical interventions while a baby is in the womb that can help prevent certain disabilities or lessen the impact of issues related to disability such as closing the spinal cord opening in people with Spina Bifida
