**RECEPTION AND ABLE INFORMATION SESSION** 



**5:30 pm – 6:30pm Reception**



The honor of your attendance at the reception is requested and will provide us an opportunity to better understand the experiences and concerns of people with disabilities in Chicago and the Midwest of the country and will give you an opportunity to talk with presidentially and congressionally appointed Council Members and full-time professional staff from the National Council on Disability.



**6:30 pm –  7:30 pm Achieving A Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act Information Session**

Come learn all about ABLE accounts and the Illinois ABLE program! ABLE accounts allow individuals with disabilities the opportunity to save and invest money without losing eligibility for certain public benefits programs, like Medicaid, Social Security, and Section 8 housing.  Earnings in ABLE accounts are not subject to federal income tax, so long as funds are spent on qualified disability expenses.  Deposits can be invested in different options chosen by the participant.  While participants can still withdraw and spend money as needed, an ABLE account also allows money to grow for when it is needed for disability expenses.
