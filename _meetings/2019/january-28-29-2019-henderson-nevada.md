She stated that she believes start promoting at an early age with programs on the start to assist parents and support systems that surround babies, children and individuals with the wording and the guidance on how to express themselves the best that they can.  She added that transition comes in all aspects of life, there are so many life transitions and the one transition to disability and making that change in gaining independence.

Mr. Bryan Hilbert stated that an individual in early intervention services regardless of the severity of their need for support will have an adult life.  

Mr. Hilbert stated that working with people to take a long-range view and to help them understand what they are doing well and what they are not will may help them to able to access the resources that they will need to build a long-term life.

Mr. Hilbert stated that he has expressed some students is that parents and the system has become foci=used on earning a high school diploma and exiting at 18 but would be better served with support services thought the age o f22.  He added that the biggest misconception that people have about individuals with disabilities is that majority of disabilities are visible and physical but are that there are individuals with mental health issues as well.

Ms. Karen Taycher stated that she would like focus to be on working with service providers and services that are funded to help individuals with disabilities to understand self-advocacy and to celebrate it.

She stated that she believes that the rights that families and children have under IDEA have been long and hard-fought for and thinks that the public schools need to do a better job embracing their students and providing appropriate education and families should not be looking for alternatives if the schools were working in the best interests of the children.

Ms. Taycher stated that educators need to be educated that there’s more out there for graduates with disabilities than programs.

Ms. Lamielle stated for 40 years the center has worked to protect public health and protect the lives of people disabled by exposure to chemical and environmental exposures.  

Nearly a third of Americans report reactions to low-level everyday environmental exposures, 30% to 60% report unusual reactivities and a smaller percent have environmental intolerances. She stated individuals are underrepresented, underserved populations suffer greatly due to significant barriers to access to the most necessities of life.

Ms. Lamielle stated people disabled in this way continue to suffer from a profound lack of access to public and commercial buildings, housings, employment, health care and other necessities.

People with these disabilities are frequently denied civil rights and full participation in society.  She added that federal agencies fail to address many issues that are basic to survival, and integration and inclusion, the mantra of independent living movement can be a threat to one’s health and well-being.

In addition to providing transportation for medical appointments, they can also utilize services to get to other locations such as for social events.  About 70% of the Medicaid trips in the state of Nevada are on public transportation, either fixed or via para transit.

Mr. Jerry Kappeler, Director of NCEP stated that one of his agency’s challenges is are the rural settings.  He stated that they are always working with the state, county and cities to get services and transportation to more rural areas with the main concentration being on getting people transitioned out the hospital newly experiencing a disability.

Mr. Dan Holland, Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) stated that they have been working with vocational rehab in Nevada for individuals who are needing transportation to get back and froth from work.  He stated that their mobility trainers work with those individuals to use fixed-route transportation.

1. **NCD Responds to the Nevada Community on National Transportation Challenges and Recommendations**

Mr. Altom stated that people love accessibility and shared his personal experiences when visiting Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

1. **NCD Shares Findings and Recommendations on Guardianship for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities**

Ms. Morgan Whitlatch, Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities stated that many states are not collecting concrete data to begin reforms that are necessary to promote responsible guardianship systems and to avoid overuse and abuse of guardianship.

She stated Quality Trust is partnering with ARC and will provide a comprehensive review of adult guardianship across disability from people with developmental disabilities who have mental health disabilities to people who have age-related disabilities and other types of disabilities.

Ms. Whitlatch stated the goal of the report is to scrutinize the impact of guardianship of people with IDD and the US policy implications under important federal laws including IDEA, the ADA the Rehabilitation Act and the Work Force Innovation and Opportunities Act.

The report consists of seven chapters. They are as follows:

* Orientation for the reader;
* School to guardianship pipeline;

* Tackling of data issues;
* Undertaken deep analysis of guardianships impact on IDD;
* Stakeholder feedback;
* Recommendations

Ms. Homa Woodrum, Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD) stated that the state of Nevada has been on a god road of reform.  There was a guardianship commission established by the supreme court that has been looking new legislation.

She stated one of the most crucial pieces of guardianship reform was guaranteed free legal representation of all individuals in all guardianship cases.

Ms. Woodrum stated in Nevada, there is a decision-making bill and the idea is to force banks, doctors and educational entities to recognize the informal supports of individuals with IDD so that we can stop the pipeline and the overburdening of the guardianship systems that are meant to be helpful for specific populations.

A mother of five stated that heir are not enough family components that are in place in Nevada, no sibling services and a delay of services for dual diagnosed children.
