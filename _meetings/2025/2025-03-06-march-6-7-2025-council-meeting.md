PUBLIC COMMENT: Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you -- individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community.

For the March 6 Council meeting, NCD will have an extended public comment period of 40 minutes and requests comments from the public regarding experiences of young people in nursing homes. Additional
information on specifics of the topic is available on NCD’s public comment page at \
<https://ncd.gov/public-comment>.

The Council will prioritize in-person commenters, but as time permits, will also receive public comment by video or audio over Zoom, and always accepts advance public comments via email. Due to the hybrid nature of the event, in-person presentations will be given priority.

To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting in any form (in-person or by Zoom), NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject
line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is March 4, 8:00 p.m. EDT. Please indicate if you are providing the comment in-person, over Zoom, or only submitting via email. All individuals desiring to make public comment
are strongly encouraged to read NCD’s guidelines for public comment in advance of the meeting at: <https://ncd.gov/public-comment>.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to experiences with young people in nursing homes.
