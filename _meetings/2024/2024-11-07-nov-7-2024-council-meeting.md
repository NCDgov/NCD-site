PUBLIC COMMENT: Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you -- individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. For the November 7 Council meeting, NCD will have a public comment session to receive perspectives on voting experiences in the Nov. 5, 2024 General Election. Commenters are encouraged to respond to the following prompts regarding their voting experience during the November 5, 2024 General Election: 

1.	Did you experience any accessibility issues when you voted?  What were they?

2.	If you did experience any accessibility issues when you voted, were the poll workers knowledgeable on how to assist so you could exercise your right to vote independently? 

Additional information on specifics of the topic and guidelines are available on NCD’s public comment page at https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by either signing up to present while registering for the meeting or sending an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is Nov. 5, 8:00 p.m. EST. 

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting are explicitly for voting experiences in the Nov. 5 General Election.
