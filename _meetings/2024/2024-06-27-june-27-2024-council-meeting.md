PUBLIC COMMENT: Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you -- individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community. For the June 27 Council meeting, NCD will have a public comment session to receive perspectives on the most notable disability policy achievements from Summer 2023 to present. NCD asks for the top three achievements from each presenter. Additional information on specifics of the topic and guidelines are available on NCD’s public comment page at https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by either signing up to present while registering for the meeting or sending an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is June 26, 8:00 p.m. EDT. 

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to most notable disability policy achievements, as the input is needed for an upcoming report. 

If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments but did not register.

CONTACT PERSON FOR MORE INFORMATION: Nicholas Sabula, Public Affairs Specialist, NCD, 1331 F Street NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 (V), or nsabula@ncd.gov.
