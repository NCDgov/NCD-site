**PUBLIC COMMENT:** Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you -- individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community.

For the February 8 Council meeting, NCD will have a public comment session to receive input on experiences with ground transportation. 

Please share your experience(s) in obtaining wheelchair accessible taxis or rideshares (e.g. Uber, Lyft).

* If you requested a wheelchair accessible van (WAV) through a taxi company, did the company have a WAV? If the company did not have WAVs in its fleet, did the taxi service offer to provide you a WAV through a different company? Was the price comparable to a non-accessible taxi?
* If you requested a WAV from a rideshare company, did the company have a WAV? If not, were you referred to a service that did? Was the price comparable to a non-accessible rideshare?
* Have you filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Department of Transportation about discrimination by a taxi company or a rideshare regarding lack of WAVs? If so, what was the result?
* Is paratransit available in your neighborhood? What are the pros and cons of using this service? What should be changed?

Additional information on specifics of the topic and guidelines are available on NCD’s public comment page at [https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/.](https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/)

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is February 7, 8:00 p.m. EDT.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to ground transportation experiences, as the input is needed for an upcoming report.

If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments but did not register.
