For the May 9 Council meeting, NCD will have a public comment session to receive input on experiences with public facilities and public transportation. Additional information on specifics of the topic and guidelines are available on NCD’s public comment page at [https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/.](https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/)

Please share your experiences and/or knowledge on the accessibility of municipal/county or private recreation facilities regarding: buildings (accessibility of buildings, locker rooms, weight rooms, exercise areas); fitness equipment (exercise machines, weight machines); exercise classes (integrated classes, modifications); swimming facilities (pool lifts, entry ramps); and other accessibility comments on private or federally financed recreation facilities. NCD also continues to seek public comment on ground transportation. Please provide comments about: the accessibility of rental cars (reservations, hand-controls, cars available for rental); and the accessibility of hotel shuttles or other public shuttles.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is May 8, 8:00 p.m. EDT.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to ground transportation experiences, as the input is needed for an upcoming report.

If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments but did not register.
