MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED: TBD


AGENDA: The times provided below are approximations for when each agenda item is anticipated to be discussed (all times Eastern Standard Time):



1:00 – 1:05 p.m. – Welcome and Call to Order
Meeting details forthcoming






5:00 p.m. – Adjournment 

PUBLIC COMMENT: Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you – individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community.


Additional information on specifics of the topic and guidelines are available on NCD’s public comment page at https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is February 7, 8:00 p.m. EDT.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to ground transportation experiences, as the input is needed for an upcoming report.

If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments but did not register.

CONTACT PERSON FOR MORE INFORMATION: Nicholas Sabula, Public Affairs Specialist, NCD, 1331 F Street NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 (V), or nsabula@ncd.gov.

ACCOMMODATIONS:  An ASL interpreter will be on-camera during the entire meeting, and CART has been arranged for this meeting and will be embedded into the Zoom platform as well as available via streamtext link.
