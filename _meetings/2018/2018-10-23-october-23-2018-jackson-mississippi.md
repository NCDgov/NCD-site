**We’re want to hear from you!**



**Your insight is instrumental and helps to steer the direction of NCD’s reports. Work is underway in the following areas and we’re ready to hear from you about those topics.** 



The five areas NCD intends to look at are organ transplants; medical futility; Quality Adjusted Life Years; Physician Assisted Suicide; and Genetic Testing.



Despite the growing understanding that disability is a normal part of the human experience, the lives of people with disabilities continue to be devalued in medical decision-making. The devaluation of people with disabilities has been widely recognized, and is apparent on the face of laws and policies that allow hospitals and physicians to deny or withhold care based on subjective criteria on quality of life, such as denying a young boy a life-saving liver transplant because he has autism, and denying a life-sustaining medical treatment to a woman with quadriplegia because the medical team determines that she will be dependent on the care of others if she survives. It is heard in the advice given to families of people with disabilities, or to people with disabilities themselves, to forgo or end medical care rather than continue life with a disability; and when a doctor describes to expectant parents that it will be expensive and emotionally burdensome if they choose to have a child that genetic tests show may have a disability. The devaluation is implicit in the lack of federal guidance making clear to the medical community that it is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act to discriminate in the provision of medical care based on a person’s disability.
