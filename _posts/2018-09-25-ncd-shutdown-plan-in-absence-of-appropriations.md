In the absence of appropriations:

• NCD officers may not incur any obligations that cannot lawfully be funded from prior appropriations unless such obligations are otherwise authorized by law.

• NCD officers may incur obligations as necessary for orderly termination of an agency's functions, but funds may not be disbursed.

• Estimated time to complete shutdown: One half-day;

• Number of on-board employees prior to execution: 10;

• Number of employees retained under plan: 0;

• Executive Director will notify OMB that shutdown procedures have initiated;

• Financial Management Analyst will notify building management of shutdown status;

• Executive Director will notify all agency personnel of shutdown status and will initiate action to issue furlough notices and other instructions as appropriate;

• Financial Management Analyst will direct Contracting Officer's Representatives to notify agency contractors of shutdown status and other instructions as appropriate;

• Executive Director will direct Network Consultant to ensure servers and other IT equipment are secured; and

• Agency personnel will be instructed to obtain information from news outlets for when a continuing resolution or an FY 2019 appropriation has been approved and that they will be expected to return to work on their next regularly scheduled work day.
