**WASHINGTON–**The National Council on Disability is seeking input from the disability community on experiences with ground transportation at next week's Council meeting.

The February 8 meeting on Zoom begins at 1 p.m. EST and will include a panel presentation and public comment opportunity focused on ground transportation for wheelchair users.

During a 30-minute public comment session at 4 p.m. EST, the public will have the opportunity to share experiences in obtaining wheelchair accessible taxis or rideshares such as Uber or Lyft. Some topics include:

* If you requested a wheelchair accessible van (WAV) through a taxi company, did the company have a WAV? If the company did not have WAVs in its fleet, did the taxi service offer to provide you a WAV through a different company? Was the price comparable to a non-accessible taxi?
* If you requested a WAV from a rideshare company, did the company have a WAV? If not, were you referred to a service that did? Was the price comparable to a non-accessible rideshare?
* Have you filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Department of Transportation about discrimination by a taxi company or a rideshare regarding lack of WAVs? If so, what was the result?
* Is paratransit available in your neighborhood? What are the pros and cons of using this service? What should be changed?

The public comment period provides an opportunity for NCD hear from you – individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. The comments  will provide data for an upcoming NCD report.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Deadline for registration is February 7, 8:00 p.m. EST.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to ground transportation experiences, as the input is needed for an upcoming report.

If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments but did not register.

Additional information on NCD’s public comment session is available on NCD’s [Public Comment](https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/) page.
