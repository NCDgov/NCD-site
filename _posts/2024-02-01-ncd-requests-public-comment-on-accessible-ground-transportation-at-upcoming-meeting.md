**WASHINGTON–**The National Council on Disability is seeking input from the disability community on experiences with public facilities and public transportation at next week's Council meeting.

The February 8 meeting on Zoom begins at 1 p.m. EST and will include a panel presentation and public comment opportunity focused on ground transportation for wheelchair users.

During a 30-minute public comment session at 4 p.m. EST, the public will have the opportunity to share experiences and/or knowledge on the accessibility of municipal/county or private recreation facilities including:

* Buildings (accessibility of buildings, locker rooms, weight rooms, exercise areas)
* Fitness equipment (exercise machines, weight machines)
* Exercise classes (integrated classes, modifications)
* Swimming facilities (pool lifts, entry ramps)
* Other accessibility comments on private or federally financed recreation facilities.
* Invitation for Public Comment on Ground Transportation
* NCD continues to seek public comment on ground transportation. Please provide comments about –
* The accessibility of rental cars (reservations, hand-controls, cars available for rental)
* The accessibility of hotel shuttles or other public shuttles

The public comment period provides an opportunity for NCD hear from you – individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. The comments  will provide data for an upcoming NCD report.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio over Zoom. To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD now requires advanced registration by sending send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email.
