**WASHINGTON–**The National Council on Disability is seeking input from the disability community on experiences with ground transportation at next week's Council meeting.

The February 8 meeting on Zoom begins at 1 p.m. EST and will include a panel presentation and public comment opportunity focused on ground transportation for wheelchair users.

During a 30-minute public comment session at 4 p.m. EST, the public will have the opportunity to share experiences in obtaining wheelchair accessible taxis or rideshares such as Uber or Lyft. 

* If you requested a wheelchair accessible van (WAV) through a taxi company, did the company have a WAV? If the company did not have WAVs in its fleet, did the taxi service offer to provide you a WAV through a different company? Was the price comparable to a non-accessible taxi?
* If you requested a WAV from a rideshare company, did the company have a WAV? If not, were you referred to a service that did? Was the price comparable to a non-accessible rideshare?
* Have you filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Department of Transportation about discrimination by a taxi company or a rideshare regarding lack of WAVs? If so, what was the result?
* Is paratransit available in your neighborhood? What are the pros and cons of using this service? What should be changed?

**PUBLIC COMMENT:**The public comment period provides an opportunity for NCDto hear from you – individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community.
