**WASHINGTON —** National Council on Disability (NCD) Chairman Neil Romano was the keynote speaker at Achieving Health Equity through Access for All with Disabilities (AHEAD) Symposium Oct. 2.

The virtual event, hosted by NYU College of Dentistry, brought together experts in the areas of health care advocacy, access, and funding at the state and federal levels for people with disabilities to discuss improving access to oral health care for people with disabilities.

Chairman Romano is introduced in the video by Dr. Steven Perlman and NYU College of Dentistry Dean Dr. Charles N. Bertolami.

Following Chairman Romano’s keynote, panel discussions will focus on funding and access issues; the family/provider relationship; the impact of COVID-19 on the disabilities community; and the importance of public-private partnerships in advancing access to care.
