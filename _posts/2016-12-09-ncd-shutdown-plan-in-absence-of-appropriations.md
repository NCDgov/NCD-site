In the absence of appropriations: 

* NCD officers may not incur any obligations that cannot lawfully be funded from prior appropriations unless such obligations are otherwise authorized by law. 
* NCD officers may incur obligations as necessary for orderly termination of an agency's functions, but funds may not be disbursed. 

2. SCOPE: This plan applies to all NCD personnel including the fifteen Special Government Employees (private citizen Presidential and Congressional appointees.)

* Estimated time to complete shutdown: One half-day; 
* Number of on-board employees prior to execution: 11; 
* Number of employees retained under plan: 0; 
* Executive Director will notify OMB that shutdown procedures have initiated; 
* Director of Administration will notify building management of shutdown status; 
* Director of Administration will notify all agency personnel of shutdown status and will initiate action to issue furlough notices and other instructions as appropriate; 
* Director of Administration will direct Contracting Officer's Representatives to notify agency contractors of shutdown status and other instructions as appropriate; 
* Director of Administration will direct Network Consultant to ensure servers and other IT equipment are secured; and 
* Agency personnel will be instructed to obtain information from news outlets for when a continuing resolution or an FY 2017 appropriation has been approved and that they will be expected to return to work on their next regularly scheduled work day.
