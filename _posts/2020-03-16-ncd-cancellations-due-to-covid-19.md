The National Council on Disability has been evaluating our meeting options with the health and well-being of our staff, members and community remaining the top priority.

In consideration of coronavirus COVID-19 developments and Federal guidance, the NCD has made the decision to postpone all in-person events and meetings until further notice.  This unfortunately includes our plans to celebrate the 30th  Anniversary of the American’s with Disabilities Act (ADA).

Our policy research and recommendations will continue to advance the rights of all people with disabilities.
