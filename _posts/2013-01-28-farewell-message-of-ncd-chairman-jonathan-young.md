Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I write with news of my resignation as Chairman of the National Council on Disability upon the official appointment of my successor, which I expect to take place in the coming days following this week’s quarterly NCD meeting.

I extend my heartfelt appreciation to President Barack Obama for bestowing on me the honor and opportunity to serve as Chairman of the National Council on Disability. Being part of President Obama’s historic and transformative Administration on behalf of people with disabilities has been an extraordinary experience and a highlight of my career. I am deeply proud of the progress NCD has made over the past three years.

I’d also like to thank current and former Council Members and staff with whom I have had the amazing opportunity to work over the past three years and from whom I have learned so much. While we bring different priorities and perspectives, everyone at NCD shares a common and abiding commitment to improving the quality of life of Americans with disabilities.

New responsibilities as Partner and General Counsel of FoxKiser, LLP led me to make the difficult decision to step aside as NCD Chairman at the conclusion of my appointed term. I leave confident that the work of NCD will continue in the capable hands of my colleagues and successor, and I look forward to continuing my work with Americans with disabilities across the nation.

In solidarity,

Jonathan Young \
Chairman, NCD
