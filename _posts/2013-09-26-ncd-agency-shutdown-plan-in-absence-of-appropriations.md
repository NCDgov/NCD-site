***UPDATE: October 1, 2013** -- Because of the absence of a Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 appropriation, National Council on Disability is compelled to “shut-down” its operations.  All National Council on Disability employees have been placed in a furlough status.  \
 \
We will return to work once a continuing resolution or an FY 2014 appropriation has been signed into law.*



**Agency Shutdown Plan\
September 26, 2013**

**1. PURPOSE:**  To provide the National Council on Disability’s (“NCD”) policy guidance and instructions for actions to be taken when Congress fails to enact either regular appropriations, a continuing resolution, or needed supplemental, resulting in an interruption of fund availability. In the absence of appropriations:

* NCD officers may not incur any obligations that cannot lawfully be funded from prior appropriations unless such obligations are otherwise authorized by law.
* NCD officers may incur obligations as necessary for orderly termination of an agency's functions, but funds may not be disbursed.

**2. SCOPE:** This plan applies to all NCD personnel including the fifteen Special Government Employees (private citizen Presidential appointees.)

**3. POLICY:** In order to execute an orderly shutdown, the following information is provided:

* Estimated time to complete shutdown: One half-day;
* Number of on-board employees prior to execution: 9;
* Number of employees retained under plan: 0;
* Executive Director will notify OMB that shutdown procedures have initiated;
* Director of Administration will notify building management of shutdown status;
* Director of Administration will notify all agency personnel of shutdown status and will initiate action to issue furlough notices and other instructions as appropriate;
* Director of Administration will direct Contracting Officer's Representatives to notify agency contractors of shutdown status and other instructions as appropriate;
* Director of Administration will direct Network Consultant to ensure servers and other IT equipment are secured; and
* Agency personnel will be instructed to obtain information from news outlets for when a continuing resolution or an FY 2014 appropriation has been approved and that they will be expected to return to work on their next regularly scheduled work day.

**4. REFERENCES:**

* OMB Circular No. A-ll (2010), Section 124.2, pages 1-2
* OMB Memo M-13-22, Planning for Agency Operations during a Potential Lapse in
