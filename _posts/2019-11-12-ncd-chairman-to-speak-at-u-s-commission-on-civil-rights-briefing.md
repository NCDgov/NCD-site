Mr. Romano was appointed to NCD in February 2015 by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Last year, he was reappointed for a second term of three years by McConnell, and was designated as Chairman by President Donald J. Trump on Feb. 28, 2018.   

First established as an advisory council within the Department of Education in 1978, NCD became an independent federal agency in 1984. In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. Since enactment of the ADA in 1990, NCD has continued to play a leading role in crafting disability policy, and advising the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policies, programs, and practices.
