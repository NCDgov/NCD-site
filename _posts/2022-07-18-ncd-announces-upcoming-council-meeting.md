The National Council on Disability (NCD) invites the public to attend its next quarterly Council Meeting July 25, 12-4 p.m. ET via Zoom.

Registration is not required, but interested parties are encouraged to register to ensure on our Eventbrite page.

Full information on the event can also be found on our Upcoming Events page.

Following welcome remarks and introductions, the Chairman and Executive Committee will provide reports; followed by an Administration, Finance, and Operations (AFO) Team update; a Policy Team update; a discussion on proposed additions to the NCD Health Equity Framework; a panel on the U.S. Supreme Court's Cummings decision with Q&A; public comment period on the Cummings decision; annual ethics training for the Council Members and staff; legislative and public affairs updates; and any old or new business, before adjourning.

For the July 25 Council meeting, NCD will designate its half-hour of public comment exclusively for community feedback on the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C.  In April 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision holding that emotional distress damages are not recoverable in a private action to enforce either the Rehabilitation Act or the Affordable Care Act. NCD seeks public comment on the impact of this holding on people with disabilities who seek redress for discrimination under these Federal statutes. In particular, NCD invites comments on the following or related topics: 

What was the importance of emotional distress damages under these statutes prior to the Cummings decision?
​What remedy/remedies remain available, under these statutes, in a private action alleging disability discrimination after Cummings, and what role can state civil or human rights laws play in providing an equivalent remedy?
What is the overall impact on civil rights protections for people with disabilities as a result of this decision?
 To provide comments or notice to present public comment, please send an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Submission should be received no later than  July 24, 5 p.m. ET to ensure inclusion.
