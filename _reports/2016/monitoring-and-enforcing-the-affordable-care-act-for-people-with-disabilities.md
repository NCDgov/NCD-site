**PURPOSE AND SCOPE:**\
*Monitoring and Enforcing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for People with Disabilities* is the final report in a three-part series on ACA from NCD, each report considering a different aspect of ACA’s implementation, impact, or ongoing enforcement.

In this, the final installment in the series, NCD examines key legal safeguards in ACA implementation regulations that can help people with disabilities secure essential care and supports. The report also outlines legal duties; identifies the parties responsible for fulfilling those duties; and in some instances, explores potential avenues for redress where applicable.

By identifying issues for monitoring by the disability community nationally and in individual states, the report seeks to ensure that Americans with disabilities have the tools to fully share in ACA’s promised benefits and assess the impact ACA has had not only on the health of people with disabilities but also on the advancement of the goals of the ADA -- equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.
