**Sï»¿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

Based on the findings of the National Council on Disability's (NCD) major studies of civil rights enforcement, and the results of the Think Tank 2000 initiative, this paper sets forth recommendations for developing a more effective and inclusive civil rights enforcement strategy for our nation over the next decade. It offers a framework for the discussion at the upcoming Civil Rights Retreat aimed at identifying a core set of strategic actions for effective enforcement that address the agendas and experiences of the diverse cultural groups which make up the civil rights constituency.
