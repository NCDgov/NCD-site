**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

T﻿his report, required by the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-394), Title II, Section 202,. describes the barriers in federal assistive technology policy to increasing the availability of and access to assistive technology devices and assistive technology services for people with disabilities.

In the ideal climate, no person with a disability should be denied the opportunity to obtain assistive technology and transfer its inherent potential into viable, life-fulfilling endeavors. However, it is clear that the current patchwork of federal policies have barriers and gaps leaving many people with disabilities without the benefits of assistive technology. This report identifies four major barriers and makes 11 recommendations for reducing those barriers.
