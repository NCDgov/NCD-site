**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

This paper looks at the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Chevron v. Echazabal and is divided into several parts. Part II provides a case synopsis. Part III sets out the legal disposition of the *Chevron* case: the facts, U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and issues on remand to the Ninth Circuit. Part IV examines the implications of the Supreme Court's *Chevron* decision for ADA law and disability policy and makes recommendations to align the definition of "direct threat" with Congressional intent. The paper concludes with a post-script describing the practical effects of the *Chevron* decision on Mario Echazabal and its ramifications for other individuals with disabilities.
