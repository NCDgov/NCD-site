**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

T﻿his position paper focuses on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, first created in 1996 to replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was slated for reauthorization in 2002. Rather than undertaking the full reauthorization, Congress passed a short extension, which has since been extended to the end of June 2003. It is likely to be reauthorized by Congress in the next few months. As part of the reauthorization process, there have been many proposals to strengthen protections for parents and children with disabilities participating in TANF-funded programs. It is important that the law establish policies that reflect both the intention and desire of people with disabilities to work, and the reality that certain individuals may still have severe work limitations requiring long-term assistance.
