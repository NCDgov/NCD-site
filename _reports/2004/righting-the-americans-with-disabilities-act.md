**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

Over the past two years, NCD conducted an in-depth analysis of the Supreme Court's interpretations of the ADA . NCD has determined that, while some of the Court's decisions have clearly liberated people with disabilities, e.g., *Tennessee v. Lane, Martin v. PGA Tours,* and *Olmstead v. L.C.,* several of the Court's rulings involving the ADA depart from the core principles and objectives of the ADA . In the enclosed report, NCD provides an analysis of the problematic rulings, describes the resulting impact on people with disabilities, and offers legislative proposals designed to restore the ADA to its original intent.
