**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

N﻿CD history review from an advisory body in the Department of Education (ED), known then as the National Council on the Handicapped, elevated to the status of an independent federal agency. The legislation that made what is now called the National Council on Disability (NCD) independent also gave it an ambitious agenda that greatly exceeded its size and modest resources.
