**Sï»¿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

This report is a unique piece of policy research cutting across multiple departments and entities of federal and state governments. NCD's research offers a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our Federal Government's current research agenda related to consumer-directed health care for Americans with disabilities. It sheds light on the relationship between consumer-directed health care and practice. And it provides a basis for policymakers who use health research evidence to inform their policy decisions (e.g., about MiCASSA, Money Follows the Person, Olmstead, and Real Choice Systems Change Grants) in keeping with the intent of your Administration's New Freedom Initiative (NFI).
