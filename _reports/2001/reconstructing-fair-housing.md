**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

This report is the fifth in a series of independent analyses by NCD of federal enforcement of civil rights laws.

*Reconstructing Fair Housing* looks at the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA) and Section 504 as they relate to one key federal agency, namely, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). NCD's findings reveal that while the past several Administrations have asserted their support for the civil rights of people with disabilities, the federal agency charged with enforcement and policy development under the FHAA and Section 504 has been underfunded, understaffed, and lacking any consistent strategy and direction.
