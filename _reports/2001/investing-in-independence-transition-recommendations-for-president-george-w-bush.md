**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

As we inaugurate the first administration of the 21st century, the Federal Government is poised to address long-standing challenges to its performance and service to Americans with disabilities. George W. Bush gave his commitment during his campaign that he and his Administration would work to "ensure that all Americans with disabilities...have every chance to pursue the American dream--to use more of their own skills and make more of their own choices. We must do everything we can to ensure that more Americans with disabilities can live independently, hold jobs, and take part in the life of their communities."

N﻿CD provides recommendations for the incoming administration.
