**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

The report was developed with the advice of NCD's Tech Watch federal advisory committee, a group of experts in technology and disability from around the country. 

To ensure that the new Information Age includes all Americans in the bounty of opportunities that are being created, NCD has taken a prospective look at the laws related to accessible electronic and information technology as an emerging civil rights concept. In this respect, NCD has examined the status of those federal entities responsible for implementing laws that protect the rights of persons with disabilities that relate to accessible electronic and information technology. Included in this report are public policy interventions that we recommend as part of an overall strategy to make the electronic bridge to the 21st century available to all Americans.
