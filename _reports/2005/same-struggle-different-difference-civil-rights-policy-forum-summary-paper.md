**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

The National Council on Disability (NCD) initiated a collaborative agreement with the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) to organize a groundbreaking public policy forum. As stated in their cooperative agreement, the entities portend that immediate benefits would include the creation of greater knowledge and understanding of the areas where the disability policy agenda and the broader civil rights agenda are in alignment.

On March 29, 2005 a one-day public policy forum brought together advocates and policy experts from the disability and broader civil rights communities across the country. More than 90 individuals from 47 civil rights and disability rights organizations attended the forum and participated in one of three working groups focused on selected topics.
