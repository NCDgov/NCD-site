**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

In recounting the past ordeals of air travelers with disabilities, NCD's report characterized their experiences as not for the faint of heart. "Often, people with certain disabilities either chose not to fly or traveled by air knowing they would probably face prejudice, hostility, disability stereotyping, as well as architectural and other physical barriers; sometimes they faced an outright denial of their right to travel." 6 And, despite the fact that the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in air transportation, is now 20 years old, the need for further strengthening and robust enforcement of its regulations and standards has not diminished.
