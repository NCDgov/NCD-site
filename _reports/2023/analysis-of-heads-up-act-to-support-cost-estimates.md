**SCOPE AND PURPOSE:**Â In this analysis, NCD seeks to determine the number of people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) who require specialized medical and dental care to support efforts to estimate the cost implications of the Healthcare Extension and Accessibility for Developmentally Disabled and Underserved Population (HEADs UP) Act (HR 3380). The HEADs UP Act would, if passed, amend the Public Health Service Act to expand and significantly improve health care services by health centers and the National Health Service Corps for individuals with I/DD.
