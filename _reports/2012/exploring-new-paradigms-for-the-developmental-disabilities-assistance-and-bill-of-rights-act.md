**SCOPE AND PURPOSE:**

In 2011, NCD released a report entitledÂ *Rising Expectations: The Developmental Disabilities Act Revisited*, which summarized the accomplishments and challenges of the DD system since the passage of the DD Act in 1963. In its synopsis, the report described the development of the DD system, which has evolved from a purely medical model to a multifaceted social model involving an interdisciplinary approach to identifying needs and delivering supports and services in the community. 

Exploring New Paradigms for the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act is a supplement to the 2011 report.
