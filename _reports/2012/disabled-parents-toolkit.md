NCD collaborated with the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation to produce this Disabled Parents Toolkit, available in standard and plain language versions. This toolkit includes lots of information that is from NCD's report called Rocking the Cradle: Ensuring the Rights of Parents with Disabilities and Their Children. You can look at a copy of that report online by going to http://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012/Sep272012.
