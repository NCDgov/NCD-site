**SUMMARY:**​ This short NCD issue brief provides insights into the lack of dental care many people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) continue to experience due to a shortage of properly trained dental care providers. The brief examines the American Dental Association's *​Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct;*​ surveys dental training and dental school curricula requirements; provides examples of programs that do train dental students in the care of patients with I/DD; explores the impact of Medicaid on the issue; and discusses the concept of medically underserved populations. The issue brief concludes with recommendations to federal and state policymakers; the Commission on Dental Accreditation; and the American Dental Association.
