**SCOPE AND PURPOSE:** In this year's annual progress report, the Council revisits the NCD report *Promises to Keep: A Decade of Federal Enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act*, released in 2000, to assess the progress made by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Access Board to address NCD’s recommendations in the 2000 report. In this year's report, NCD also uses the framework developed in *Promises to Keep* to consider the efforts of the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) Employment and Training Administration, Office of Disability Employment Policy, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Office of the Solicitor, and the Wage and Hour Division to protect and advance the employment of people with disabilities. This report assesses how these agencies implement and enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act and other federal disability rights laws and programs, offers key findings from this assessment, and concludes by offering recommendations to enhance the agencies' investigative and compliance efforts.
