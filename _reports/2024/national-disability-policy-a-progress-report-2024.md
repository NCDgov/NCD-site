**SCOPE AND PURPOSE**: The 2024 NCD Progress Report provides a summary of approximately a year’s worth of developments in disability policies. In this report, NCD assesses the progress made in achieving disability policies and identifies new and emerging issues. NCD restates several of its existing recommendations on the topics addressed in the report as a measure by which to gage progress.

**Key Updates**:

* **Healthcare policy**: The report notes the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities' designation of people with disabilities as a “Health Disparities Population” and the final Section 504 (of the Rehabilitation Act) rule by the Office for Civil Rights of the US Department of Health and Human Services.
*  **Transportation policy**: The report notes the 2024 Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act and the proposed regulation by the US Department of Transportation, guidelines provided by the U.S. Access Board, and ongoing accessibility improvements made by Amtrak.
* **Employment policy**: The report focuses its consideration of employment disability policy in the AbilityOne program and Tribal Lands Vocational Rehabilitation.
*  **Housing policy**: The report touches on issues surrounding housing for people with disabilities after disasters, specifically FEMA’s interim final rule (IFR), which applies to emergencies and major disasters declared on or after March 22, 2024.
