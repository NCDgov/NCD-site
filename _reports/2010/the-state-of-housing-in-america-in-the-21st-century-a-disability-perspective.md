**SCOPE AND PURPOSE:**

While great strides have been made by the National Council on Disability and others to advance the notion of livable communities for all, there are still gaps in the knowledge about what exactly is needed to transform our communities. Affordable, accessible, and appropriate housing is a critical and integral part of making any community more livable for people with disabilities. This report looks at the state of housing for people with disabilities with the intent to provide recommendations that can improve housing opportunities. The research contained in this report provides a comprehensive overview of the state of housing in the 21st century and answers to seven important questions about the current housing needs and options for people with disabilities living in the United States.
