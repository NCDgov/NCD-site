**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

This NCD report defines or describes financial incentives affecting people with disabilities and presents research findings in key areas of people's lives, such as education and health care. It also describes selected state-level innovations affecting asset development and wealth accumulation. In addition, the report suggests several strategies for securing meaningful employment, career advancement, and benefits needed for daily living and accommodations.

*The State of 21st Century Financial Incentives for Americans with Disabilities* recognizes that the potential for Americans with disabilities to become full citizens cannot and will not be realized without a redesign of public policy. To that end, this report offers recommendations that can increase opportunities for people with disabilities to become fully involved in the economic mainstream of American society.
