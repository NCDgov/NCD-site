**Chairman Andrés J. Gallegos, Esq.**, 62, of Illinois, passed away Dec. 1,. 2023. 

U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, recommended Gallegos, of Chicago, be appointed to the Council to then-U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who obliged the recommendation and appointed Gallegos to the Council on Feb. 7, 2018. Gallegos was then also serving as Chairman of the Board for Access Living.

He officially joined the Council after taking his oath of office on Feb. 22, 2018. A few years later, Sen. Duckworth again recommended Gallegos to then-President-Elect Biden to serve as NCD’s chairman. On January 20, 2021, President Biden designated Gallegos Chairman of NCD shortly after being inaugurated President of the United States.

Gallegos was a U.S. Air Force veteran, serving 14 years before pursuing his law degree at St. Louis University’s School of Law, graduating in 1993. He gave the 2022 graduating class commencement speech.

He was a well-regarded disability rights attorney in Chicago, who often remarked that he joined the “Disability Class of 1996,” after acquiring quadriplegia due to a spinal cord injury from a car accident. His disability would shape his experiences navigating his legal profession, and pursuits of disability rights.

“In a fraction of a second, I joined a beautiful community—a community today that consists of over 61.4 million people in the United States and in our territories,” he said, adding, “Disability is not something that needs to be avoided, not something that needs to be feared, and not something that needs to be cured.”

Council members are appointed by the President, and majority and minority leaders of the U.S. House and Senate. The President designates the chair of NCD.

Since Gallegos was appointed to the Council in 2018, NCD released 31 reports and papers--15 while chair--making systemic recommendations to improve national disability policy. These full-length publications were in addition to dozens of letters of advisement to various policymakers. To start his time as chair, he published a vision and priority statement focused on health equity, then led a cadre of esteemed disability health experts—known as his “Dream Team”—through lengthy discussions, ultimately crafting the Framework to End Health Disparities of People with Disabilities as a policy blueprint for recommended changes across government.
