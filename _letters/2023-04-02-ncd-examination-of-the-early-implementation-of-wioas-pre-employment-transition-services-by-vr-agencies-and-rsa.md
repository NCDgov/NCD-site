**Implementation Memorandum from NCD to RSA**

In its statutory role as an advisor to the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) on programs carried out under the Rehabilitation Act, NCD submitted an implementation report memorandum to the Acting Commissioner of RSA regarding the findings of its recent examination of the implementation of new requirements under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA) regarding pre-employment transition services (PETS) within the first two-and-a-half years since its enactment.

The examination is the outcome of the responses to a questionnaire that NCD sent to 25 VR agencies - some general VR and some VR services for the blind - which sought out information regarding:

* How many students were receiving PETS
* The types of PETS being provided by VR agencies
* How VR agencies were providing PETS
* Challenges to implementation to date
* Strengths and weaknesses in RSA's support of implementation

The memorandum outlines NCD's findings as a result of the examination of the responses received, and offers RSA and Congress several recommendations on the basis of information received from the questionnaire responses.
