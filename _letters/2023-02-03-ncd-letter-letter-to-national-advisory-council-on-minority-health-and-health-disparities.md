Re:     National Advisory Council on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NACMHD) Working Group Presentation

Dear Dr. Cotton:

Foremost, thank you for the opportunity for the National Council on Disability (NCD) to brief the esteemed members of NACMHD Working Group on December 13, 2022, and assist in its task to evaluate the risks and benefits of designating people with disabilities as a health disparity population.

Below, we provide a summary of the salient points of our presentation, and as requested, we provide additional information relating to bias and stigma, and attached to the email transmitting this letter is a copy of the presentation deck that we used for that presentation.

To reemphasize the salient points of our presentation:

* the designation of people with disabilities as a health disparity population under the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000, is one of the core components of *NCD's Health Equity Framework*, which we released last February. When we look at the statutory definition of a health disparities population1 – to us, it is inarguable that people with disabilities fall clearly within the definition given the significant disparity in the overall rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality as compared to our nondisabled counterparts;
* NCD’s December 7, 2021 letter to Director Perez-Stáble and Director Meyers of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality identified the well-developed body of studies and reports that document the continuing prevalence of health disparities between the now over 64 million people with disabilities and their nondisabled counterparts, citing to 37 peer reviewed studies between 2011 and 2020.2 Those studies highlight the disparities in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality and survival rates related to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, hypertension, kidney and liver conditions, and chronic illness, in addition to identifying persons with disabilities as likely to experience co-occurring disabilities like mental illness, physical disability, sensory disability. Those cited studies also document disparities between people with disabilities and their non- disabled counterparts in accessing healthcare services, like maternity care, routine healthcare services, dental care and preventive care and screenings; and further document that people with disabilities have significantly higher odds ratios for physical inactivity and smoking and face physical access barriers to healthcare. The mountain of empirical evidence gives voice to the continuous struggles that people with disabilities are experiencing in receiving even basic healthcare and shows the significant health disparities between persons with disabilities and those without;
* this past October, *Health Affairs,* dedicated the entirety of its journal to highlight significant health disparities between people with disabilities and those without. Those studies reiterated findings from the prior decade. For example: a study titled *Perinatal Health Risks And Outcomes Among US Women With Self- Reported Disability, 2011–19,* revealed that women with disabilities experience elevated risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Researchers analyzed data, including self-reported disability status, from the National Survey of Family Growth for the period 2011–19. They compared respondents with and without disabilities on these characteristics: smoking during pregnancy, delayed prenatal care, preterm birth, and low birthweight. A total of 19.5 percent of respondents who had given birth reported a disability, which is a much higher prevalence than estimates reported in US studies using diagnosis codes. Respondents with disabilities were twice as likely as those without disabilities to have smoked during pregnancy (19.0 percent versus 8.9 percent). They also had 24 percent and 29 percent higher risk for preterm birth and low birthweight, respectively;
* another October *Health Affairs* study, *Advancing Health Equity And Reducing Health Disparities For People With Disabilities In The United States,* found people with disabilities are more likely to report poor health and experience higher rates of chronic health conditions than nondisabled people. Data published in 2012 and 2015 indicate that disabled adults were more likely to experience chronic conditions such as cardiac disease, diabetes, higher weight, and asthma and to lack emotional support. That same study found that disabled women are more likely than their nondisabled peers to have chronic health conditions and to describe their general health as fair or poor. Women with disabilities have lower rates of breast and cervical cancer screening compared with nondisabled women, and disabled women with circulatory or respiratory conditions have higher rates of breast cancer mortality than women without disabilities;
* the COVID-19 pandemic shone a light on those significant disparities and our country’s decades-long inattention to the healthcare needs of people with disabilities. It is not that disability *per se* is a predictor of contracting COVID-19 virus, it is the secondary conditions not related to disability that place us at greater risk for contracting the virus and in a higher risk for severe outcomes including death. Comorbidities are a serious health concern because the presence of two or more conditions increases the chances of hospitalization and the risk of death and affects quality of life. When a person experiences comorbid conditions, they may have a compromised immune system or need additional care that exposes them to others. This was particularly true for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The historical inattention to care treatment and the resulting health disparities, placed people with disabilities at great risk and weakened our resiliency to fight back against the virus;
* we noted the working group’s task was to evaluate *risks* and *benefits* of designating people with disabilities as a health disparities population. And the fundamental question that we had was, respectfully, thru what lens? How do individual committee members view disability and persons with disabilities? Is it through the historic and dominant social construct of the *medical model of disability,* which defines disability as an impairment or problem existing within the body or mind that can be identified by objective scientific or expert observations and ameliorated with the guidance or treatment of experts to help the person adapt and conform to the “normal” environment? A construct that views us as incapable of contributing to society. Or is it through the construct of the *social model of disability?* A model that challenges the *medical model’s* definition identifying disabled people as defective and disabled lives as inherently inferior to nondisabled lives. From a *social model* perspective, disability occurs when a person with an impairment interacts with physical or social environments that do not take the full range of human body variation into consideration and are unaccommodating or hostile as a result. In the *social model*, disability is a social construct, and disabled people are an oppressed minority group with unique histories and perspectives;
* we asked the foregoing questions because we know that how physicians see us is how they treat us. We have seen the research relating to black and brown persons in the country that clearly states that racism is a serious threat to public health.3 Studies that led to acknowledging proclamations by the *American*
* more importantly, we further noted the same prevalence of conditions that was the impetus for the creation of the National Institute of Minority Health to address health disparities affecting racial and ethnic minority groups - are the same that are identified as contributing to significant disparities for our community. Those conditions were detailed in the Institute of Medicine’s 2003 seminal report, “Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care.” 4 The Institute of Medicine then found, in the last twenty years, the literature had highlighted the fact that racial and ethnic disparities occur not only in health, but also in health care, and that many sources, including health care systems, health care providers, patients and utilization managers, are contributors – as is the case for people with disabilities;
* we cited recent studies by one of NCD’s dream team advisors in the formulation of our Health Equity Framework, Dr. Lisa Iezzoni, with Harvard Medical School, and her colleagues, published in *Health Affairs*. The first, in February 2021, found that over 82% physicians nationwide view people with significant disabilities as having a low quality of life.5 And an October 2022 follow-up study conducted by Dr. Iezzoni and her colleagues also published in *Health Affairs* revealing conversations with physicians under the cloak of anonymity wherein they revealed their preference not to treat us; admitting sending us to cattle processing plants, supermarkets, zoos and grain elevator facilities to get weighed; and telling us their practices are closed and not accepting new patients, when in fact they are open and accepting new patients, but not those with disabilities;6 and
* we expressed our hope that the task of this working group would be not to focus on *risks* and *benefits*, because that seems to be clear. The absence of the health disparity population designation perpetuates the suffering and death within our community, a community of over 64.3 million people as of last year according to the CDC. The benefits lie in preventable deaths, millions of reduced hospitalizations, and a healthier population that comprises over 26% of the total population in this country. The designation will allow us to truly live independent lives, seek and maintain gainful employment, and improve the overall quality of our lives.

With respect to data relating to physicians’ bias and stigma towards people with disabilities, consider:

* the 2019–20 national survey finding that 82.4 percent of out-patient physicians reported that people with significant disability have worse quality of life than nondisabled people, and only 40.7 percent were very confident that they could provide the same quality of care to patients with disability as to their nondisabled patients.7
* the 2020 study examining results from 25,0006 physicians’ implicit association tests, finding that although health care professionals across disciplines self- reported little explicit prejudice against disabled people, their implicit attitudes revealed ableist bias.8
* A 2004 qualitative study of people who were deaf or hard of hearing identified clinicians may believe that people with hearing loss have low intelligence and disrespect their perspectives.9

Moreover, in 2019, we published a five-part series on biomedical ethics and discrimination against people with disabilities. The three most relevant are:

* Organ Transplant Discrimination Against People with Disabilities: People with disabilities are often denied equal access to organ transplants solely on the basis of their disability. Additionally, the report explores how people with disabilities and their families can be pressured into organ donation;10
* Medical Futility: Health care providers’ subjective judgments about whether a patient’s life is “worth living” often influences their decisions regarding whether to withdraw or withhold medical care. Several studies have demonstrated that health care providers’ opinions about the quality of life of a person with a disability significantly differ from the actual experiences of those people. For example, one study found that only 17 percent of providers anticipated an average or better quality of life after a spinal cord injury (SCI) compared with 86 percent of the actual SCI comparison group. The same study found that only 18 percent of emergency care providers imagined that they would be glad to be alive after experiencing a spinal cord injury, in contrast to the 92 percent of actual SCI survivors;11 and
* The Danger of Assisted Suicide Laws: Physician’s attitudes and belief that the quality of life of people with disabilities is low poses the danger of referral to assisted suicide more quickly and easily than referral for patients without pre- existing disabilities. People with disabilities can be referred to assisted suicide rather than mental health counseling for suicide ideation.12

We saw early on during the start of the pandemic and continuing throughout its height, systemic Ableism by public health officials in many jurisdictions throughout the country that blatantly discriminated against people with disabilities from receiving care and treatment for the COVID-9 virus. It prompted us to write to the Director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR), urging OCR to take action to prevent medical discrimination against people with disabilities who contract the coronavirus.13 

We hope that you and the Working Group find the above helpful. If we can be of any further assistance as you continue this important work, please reach out to us.

Respectfully,

  

Andrés J. Gallegos, J.D.\

It’s important to note HHS has been attempting to address this identical problem for decades. In 2000 when it released its Healthy People 2010 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, cautioned that "as a potentially underserved group, people with disabilities would be expected to experience disadvantages in health and well-being compared with the general population."

(2022) Health inequities arise from unfair conditions faced by persons with disabilities. Two highlighted factors are: *Structural factors*: Persons with disabilities experience ableism, stigma and discrimination in all facets of life, which affects their physical and mental health. Laws and policies may deny them the right to make their own decisions and allow a range of harmful practices in the health sector, such as forced sterilization, involuntary admission and treatment, and even institutionalization. *Health system*: Persons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system. For example, a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes, and discriminatory practices among healthcare workers; inaccessible health facilities and information; and lack of information or data collection and analysis on disability, all contribute to health inequities faced by this group. *https://*[www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health)

Schneider, and Dara Strolovitch. HEALTH AFFAIRS 41, NO. 10 (2022): 1513– 1522. Respondents were 5.5 percentage points less likely to allocate a ventilator to a patient with a disability than to a nondisabled patient. Disability bias was correlated with older age cohorts and higher education levels of respondents. These findings demonstrate the importance of bias mitigation and civil rights enforcement in health policy making, especially under conditions of scarcity. *https://*[www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00504](http://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00504)

* *Disability Bias in Health Care Unearthing the influence of bias on health care* *policies and clinical decision-making.* Harvard Law School Project on Disability. Oct 20, 2021. Describes how various forms of disability bias can affect clinical practice. For example, "ineffectual bias" manifests when clinicians assume patients with disabilities possess lower levels agency and competence than non- disabled patients with the same presenting medical complaint and thus treat them paternalistically. "Fragility bias" arises when clinicians perceive that patients with disabilities suffer more than non-disabled patients who present with the same medical facts, which can lead to more conservative treatments. Conversely, "catastrophe bias" causes clinicians to project more suffering onto patients with disabilities than patients actually experience based on the clinicians' assumptions that patients' disabilities diminish their quality of life, inducing clinicians to “give up” sooner than they would for non-disabled patients. *<https://hpod.law.harvard.edu/news/entry/disability-bias-in-health-care>*

They further contend that “\[i]mmediately, and from early life and thereafter, people perceive individuals with disability as ‘vulnerable’ and of low competence, and, accordingly, treat members of this group differently.” Consequently, people with disabilities often continue to experience social devaluation on account of their disabilities (i.e., ableism), despite the fact that the last few decades have seen an increased awareness and a decreased social acceptability of discrimination based on other characteristics such as race (i.e., racism) and gender (i.e., sexism). People with disabilities thus remain subjected to ableist attitudes in many sectors, including — often especially *—* the health care system.” *https://*[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6488478/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6488478/)
* *The Harm of Ableism: Medical Error and Epistemic Injustice*. David M. Peña- Guzmán et al. Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal. Johns Hopkins University Press. Volume 29, Number 3, September 2019. This paper argues that epistemic errors rooted in group- or identity-based biases, especially those pertaining to disability, are undertheorized in the literature on medical error. After sketching dominant taxonomies of medical error, we turn to the field of social epistemology to understand the role that epistemic schemas play in contributing to medical errors that disproportionately affect patients from marginalized social groups. We examine the effects of this unequal distribution through a detailed case study of ableism. There are four primary mechanisms through which the epistemic schema of ableism distorts communication between nondisabled physicians and disabled patients: testimonial injustice, epistemic overconfidence, epistemic erasure, and epistemic derailing. Measures against epistemic injustices in general and against schema-based medical errors in particular are ultimately issues of justice that must be better addressed at all levels of health care practice.
* AMA Journal of Ethics, December 2018, Volume 20, Number 12: E1181-1187 MEDICINE AND SOCIETY. *Three Things Clinicians Should Know About* *Disability*, Joel Michael Reynolds, PhD. “Ableism undermines clinicians’ ability to engage with patients with disabilities as they in fact live their lives; it distorts communication with all patients regarding transitions into and experiences of various states of disability, whether due to age, injury, or other factors; and it misaligns the ultimate priorities of medical care insofar as it fosters an unreflective support of normalcy. In all these ways, ableism leads to worse care and increases the chances of harm. Ableism also contributes to a specific and persistent issue dogging medical communication: the ableist conflation of disability with disease, illness, pain, suffering, and disadvantage. To be disabled is not automatically or necessarily to suffer or be in pain or to have an illness or disease….Disability is in many respects as complex and contextual as any other significant facet of human identity such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and so on.” *[https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/three-things-clinicians-sho...](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/three-things-clinicians-should-)* *know-about-disability/2018-* *12#:~:text=For%20shorthand%2C%20I%20refer%20to,disability%2C%20diseas* *e%2C%20and%20illness*.

It involves bias against those who look different and function differently. It reflects hostility towards those who require and increasingly demand alternative physical and social arrangements to accommodate them, and in some cases need a larger share of societal resources. It stems from the frightened belief that disability inevitably means loss of control, social isolation, loss of an essential part of your humanity, and the related deep-seated anxiety that this could happen to me or someone close to me.” *<https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ilmed3&div=24&i>* *d=&page=*

* *COVID-19 and Disability-Based Discrimination in Health Care.* American Bar Association. Elizabeth Pendo. May 22, 2020. People with disabilities, who can be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, experience significant inequities in health and health care. One of the reasons for these inequities is persistent disability discrimination and negative bias in the provision of medical treatment. Although bias can be explicit or implicit, studies have consistently demonstrated that health care providers hold negative views of people with disabilities and fail to fully appreciate the value and quality of life with a disability. Disability advocates and organizations have raised serious concerns about the impact of triage policies that exclude, disadvantage, or otherwise discriminate on the basis of disability. Examples of problematic provisions include: categorical exclusions based on disability, such as intellectual or developmental disability; explicit or implicit quality-of-life assessments; assumptions regarding long-term survival that disadvantage people with disabilities; failure to incorporate reasonable modifications in receiving treatment, including allowing for longer time on a ventilator; provisions authorizing reallocation of ventilators from chronic ventilator users to other patients; assumptions or concerns about the ability of people with intellectual and developmental disorders to comply with post-treatment protocols; and overall failure to require an individual assessment of each patient to avoid decisions based on diagnoses and stereotypes. *https://*[www.americanbar.org/groups/diversity/disabilityrights/resources/covid19-](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/diversity/disabilityrights/resources/covid19-) *disability-discrimination/*
