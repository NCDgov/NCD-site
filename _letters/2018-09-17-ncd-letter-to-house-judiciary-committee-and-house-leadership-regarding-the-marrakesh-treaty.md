Re: S.2559 - Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Act

Dear Gentlemen:

I write on behalf of the National Council on Disability (“NCD”) - an independent, nonpartisan federal agency charged with providing advice to the President, Congress and federal agencies on matters affecting the lives of people with disabilities - to urge the Committee on the Judiciary to adopt, and the House to immediately pass S. 2559 - Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Act - to increase the amount of accessible reading material for millions of Americans with print disabilities.

Currently, despite the ability to convert print books into accessible formats like Braille, audio, and digital copies, over 95 percent of published works are unavailable to people with print disabilities.[1](https://ncd.gov/publications/2018/ncd-letter-house-judiciary-committee-and-house-leadership-regarding-marrakesh#_ftn1) As a result, millions of Americans are prevented from accessing most information for education, employment, and personal enrichment. This is a situation that must be remedied and S.2559 is designed to do so.

On June 28, 2018, the Senate unanimously provided its advice and consent to the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (Marrakesh Treaty). The Marrakesh Treaty is a multilateral agreement that provides a framework for Americans with print disabilities to receive accessible format materials from other countries. At the same time, the Senate passed S.2559 and referred the implementing legislation to the House. This legislation will adjust the United States copyright law to fully conform to the terms of the Marrakesh Treaty.

NCD fully supports the swift passage of S.2559. It will provide the opportunity for people with print disabilities to access a world of published works and will continue the legacy of the United States as the world’s leader in equal rights and inclusion for people with disabilities.

If you have any questions, please contact, Joan Durocher, General Counsel at [jdurocher@ncd.gov](mailto:jdurocher@ncd.gov) or Ana Torres-Davis, Attorney-Advisor at [atorresdavis@ncd.gov](mailto:atorresdavis@ncd.gov).

Respectfully,

Neil Romano\
Chairman
