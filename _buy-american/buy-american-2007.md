Dear Senator Feingold:

Thank you for your letter of July 29, 2008, inquiring about the status of Buy American Act (BAA) reports from the National Council on Disability (NCD). We apologize for the delay in responding, but wanted to let you know that we did submit reports for Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006, as required. A copy of our 2006 report is attached..

We are also aware that, in accordance with 41 U.S.C. ยง10a, the head of each federal agency is required to submit a report to Congress on the amount of acquisitions made by the agency from entities that manufacture end products outside the United States. This letter provides information for NCD acquisitions for Fiscal Year 2007, including procurements from foreign manufacturers and waivers (if any) from the BAA. NCD responses are:

During FY 2007, NCD did not purchase any articles, materials or supplies that were manufactured outside the United States.
Waivers of the BAA were neither granted nor necessary for acquisitions conducted.
NCD total obligations for goods manufactured in the United States were $38,568 for FY 2007.
As required, this report will be made available for public viewing on our Web site at www.ncd.gov. If you would like additional information, please contact Michael Collins, NCD Executive Director at 202-272-2004 or mcollins@ncd.gov.

Sincerely,

John R. Vaughn
Chairperson
